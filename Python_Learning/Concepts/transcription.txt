1.python tutorial for beginners
0:00
what's up everybody in this video I'm going to teach you everything you need to know to start coding with Python i've
0:06
also included 20 different hands-on projects to help you learn you can find the entire list in the description of
0:12
this video our final project will be a weather app that fetches real-time weather data from an API even if you've
0:19
never coded anything in your life before I'll walk you through the basics the ABCs of programming if that sounds good
0:25
to you then I encourage you to sit back relax and enjoy the
0:32
show this course doesn't cost you anything but if you would like to help me out you can help increase its reach

by hitting the like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to be a fellow bro thank
0:44
you i appreciate it i don't like boring introductions so I say we just jump right in there's two things we'll need
0:51
to download the first is a Python interpreter to convert our written code to machine code we're going to head to
1:00
python.org go to downloads and download the latest
1:05
version we will open this executable if you're on Windows you'll
1:12
want to check this check box add Python exe to path and we will install now
1:22
the setup was successful and that's all you need to do to download the Python
1:27
interpreter the second download we'll need is an IDE an integrated development
1:33
environment basically a place where we can write code for IDEES there's two
1:38
popular choices when writing Python code pycharm and VS Code if you already use
1:44
VS Code you can stick with that just be sure to download the Python extension i find PyCharm more beginner friendly if
1:52
you've never coded before if you would like to use PyCharm go to
1:59
jetbrains.com/pycharm and we will click this green download button there's two versions of PyCharm
2:06
the professional version and the community version the professional version is paid for i would not
2:12
recommend using it only because there's plenty of free IDE on the market we'll use the community edition the free one
2:19
because I don't like to pay for things and I'm sure you don't either select the correct download for your operating
2:25
system i'm running Windows i will download PyCharm we will open this
2:33
executable click next you could select a destination folder i'll keep it as is
2:41
next I'll create a desktop shortcut but you don't necessarily need
2:46
to click next install and we'll just have to give
2:51
it a moment okay the setup is now complete
2:57
i'll check this checkbox to run PyCharm when we close this window after opening PyCharm we're going
3:05
to create a new project you can rename your Python project i'll keep it as is you can
3:11
select a location again I won't change that you can create a sample welcome script but for this tutorial we won't
3:19
let's select the latest Python version and create our new
3:25
project in the menu to the left we're going to create a new Python file file
3:31
new Python file let's name this file main
3:38
but really you can name it anything and select Python file python files end with the py file
3:49
extension we should have our main Python file within our Python project folder
3:54
now we're going to print something to the console window within our main Python file we're going to write a print
4:01
statement so type print add a set of parenthesis between the set of
4:06
parenthesis we will add a set of double quotes to print something or single
4:11
quotes either one my own preference is double quotes normally in a programming
4:17
tutorial the instructor would tell you to print something such as hello world
4:22
but we like to be different here instead think of your favorite food
4:28
in this case I like pizza i will print I like pizza
4:35
to run our Python program we will click the screen arrow to run our main Python
4:42
file we should have a console window that displays our output i like pizza or
4:48
whatever your favorite food is let's print another line of code
4:54
let's print it's really
5:01
good by adding a second print statement we are printing a second line of
5:07
code now we'll discuss comments the Python interpreter doesn't
5:12
output comments to write a comment you use a pound sign i like to call this a
5:18
hashtag my comment will be this is my first Python
5:25
program comments are used as notes for yourself or for other people reading this code if I were to run this code
5:33
again this comment is not displayed to the output we still have I like pizza
5:39
it's really good all right everybody so that is your very first Python program
5:44
and in the next topic we'll discuss variables all right everybody we are moving on to
2.variables
5:51
variables a variable is a container for a value there's four different data types we'll discuss strings integers
5:59
floats and booleans yes I know that's a silly name a variable behaves as if it
6:05
was the value it contains each variable should have a unique name let's say we have a variable of first name to assign
6:13
a variable you use the assignment operator of equals for text a string is
6:19
a series of text this can be double quotes or single quotes my own preference is double quotes why don't
6:26
you type in your first name this variable of first name will behave as if
6:32
it was this value this series of characters so to demonstrate this I'm
6:37
going to print my first name variable so place it within a print
6:43
statement without quotes that will print your first name now you don't want this
6:49
within quotes because then you're literally printing the word first
6:57
name you could use your variable along with some text by using what is called
7:02
an F string that's the easiest way to display a variable so you type F then a
7:07
set of quotes the F means format so let's say the word hello then
7:14
we will add our variable we will insert our variable into this text when using an F string to do that you need a set of
7:21
curly braces then insert your variable so the result is hello whatever your
7:28
first name is in my case bro let's create another variable let's say we have a variable of
7:36
food food equals think of your favorite food for me I will type pizza
7:44
let's print the following you like add a placeholder
7:50
again I'm using an F string our variable of food hello bro
7:56
you like pizza let's create an email use your own email or make up one
8:03
let's say my email is bro123@fake.com
8:11
then let's print our email your email is add a placeholder
8:19
display our email variable your email is
8:27
bro123@fake.com so these are strings i'm going to add a comment that these are
8:33
strings a string is a series of characters they can include numbers but
8:38
we treat them as characters now we have integers an integer is a whole number an
8:46
example of this could be somebody's age how old are they according to my YouTube
8:51
statistics many of you are between the ages of 18 through 24 let's say that I'm
8:56
25 let me zoom in a little your integer should not be within quotes because it
9:03
would be a string then technically if I would like to work with this variable again I'll use an f string
9:10
let's say you are add a placeholder display our age
9:16
variable years old you are 25 years old
9:23
another example of an integer could be a quantity you are buying a certain amount
9:29
of something maybe I am buying three items i wouldn't have half an item this
9:35
would be a float technically rather than an integer we are buying three of
9:40
something so let's print the following you are
9:47
buying add a placeholder display our quantity
9:53
items you are 25 years old you are buying three
9:59
items another example of an integer could be an amount of people let's say
10:05
num of students like a classroom there are 30 students in our
10:11
class then we will print your class has add a
10:19
placeholder students we will display the number of students num of
10:26
students your class has 30 students those are integers they're
10:32
whole numbers and again make sure they're not within quotes because then technically they would be a string
10:40
integers we can use in arithmetic expressions if they were strings we
10:45
couldn't then we have floats float means floatingoint
10:51
number a float is a number but it contains a decimal portion an example would be a price what is the price of
10:58
something $10.99 let's print our price print i'll
11:03
use an F string the price is add a placeholder display our
11:10
price the price is $10.99 let's preede our placeholder with
11:15
a unit of currency i'll pick American dollars but feel free to pick something else the price is
11:23
$10.99 so floats contain a decimal portion what about a grade point average
11:29
GPA let's say my GPA is 3.2
11:36
then I will print your GPA
11:43
is display our GPA your GPA is
11:50
3.2 what about a distance a distance can contain a decimal portion
11:56
5.5 kilometers maybe then I will
12:02
print you ran add a placeholder display our distance then I'll add km for
12:09
kilometers or you could add mi for miles but I'll stick with
12:15
kilome you rand 5.5 km okay then we have booleans a boolean
12:22
is either true or false let's say we're a student is
12:31
student equals if we are a student we could say that this is true true starts
12:37
with a capital T if we weren't a student let's say we graduate we could say that
12:43
this is false again the first letter is capital booleans only have two options
12:49
true or false so let's say that I am a student then I will
12:55
print are you a student then we will display our boolean value
13:02
of is student are you a student that is true with boolean values we really don't
13:10
output them directly you're more likely to see them used internally within a program such as when working with if
13:16
statements this is a topic we'll discuss in the future so don't worry you may see
13:22
if is student if this variable is true then we will print the
13:29
following now we don't need to use an string we're not going to insert any variables you are a student if this were
13:37
false we can add an else clause where we will print you are not a
13:47
student our variable of is student is true we will print the if statement you
13:53
are a student if this were false we will print whatever is within
13:58
else you are not a student let's think of a few more examples is something for sale like a
14:07
car or a product of some sort let's say that is true i'll write another if
14:13
statement if for sale if this variable contains true we will do the following
14:21
let's print that item is for
14:26
sale else if it's false we will print something
14:32
else that item is not
14:38
available for sale is set to true this variable is true we will print
14:44
that item is for sale else if it were false we print that item is not
14:51
available one more example let's say we have a boolean variable of is online is
14:58
somebody online i will set that to true if is online if that's true we will
15:07
print you are online else we will
15:12
print you are offline is online is set to true we will
15:20
print you are online else if it were false we print you're
15:26
offline all right everybody so those are variables a variable is a reusable
15:31
container for a value there's four basic data types for beginners a string which
15:36
is a series of text integers which are whole numbers floats which are numbers
15:42
but they contain a decimal portion and booleans which are either true or false
15:48
they're binary your assignment in the comment section is to post four variables post a string an integer a
15:56
float and a boolean try and think of a unique example if you can and well everybody those are variables in
3.type casting
16:05
Python all right everybody so we are moving on to type casting typ casting is
16:10
the process of converting a variable from one data type to another we have
16:15
various functions to convert a value or variable to a string an integer a float
16:21
or a boolean let's create some variables we will create a name variable type in
16:28
your full name an age make up some age a GPA for grade point average let's
16:37
say minus 3.2 and a boolean of is student are we
16:43
currently a student let's say that's true now you actually could get the data
16:49
type of a variable or a value by using the type function then pass in a value
16:54
or variable however when I run this there's no output so I need a print
17:01
statement we will print what is returned by the type function get the type of our
17:07
name variable then print it so our name variable is a string
17:14
str our age variable is an integer and
17:20
int GPA is a float is student is a boolean using
17:29
these type cast functions we can convert from one data type to another here's how
17:35
let's start with something simple let's convert our GPA to an integer currently it's a float i will reassign
17:43
GPA use the int function to type cast to an integer then pass in my GPA at the
17:51
end we will print our GPA if we type cast 3.2 to a whole
17:57
integer what would the result be a whole integer of three we truncate the decimal
18:05
portion let's convert our age to a floatingoint number we will reassign our
18:10
variable of age use the type cast function a float
18:15
then insert our age variable let's print our age
18:22
variable and it should be a floating point number
18:27
25.0 now we'll cover strings let's type cast our age to be a string age
18:35
equals call the type cast function of string str pass in our age
18:42
variable so the result is still going to appear the same 25 however it's a string not an
18:51
integer and to prove that I will enclose my age variable with the type
18:57
function the type of variable age is a string it would be the same as if we're taking
19:03
this number and enclosing it within quotes so this would make a difference
19:10
because let's say that I add one to age age plus equals
19:15
1 well we would get a type error can only concatenate strings not integers to
19:22
a string however if I were to add a string of one to the end we would be using
19:28
string concatenation so let's say it's my birthday and I add 1 to 25 well since
19:34
we're working with strings now the result would be 251 i am 251 years
19:41
old so strings and numbers behave differently with numbers we can use them
19:47
within arithmetic expressions strings not so much we will take our name
19:53
variable and type cast it to a boolean
19:58
name equals call the typcast function of bool pass in our name
20:04
variable this has an interesting result so I'm going to print name booleans are
20:10
either true or false if I type cast my string of text into a boolean that gives
20:17
me true now it really doesn't matter what I write here if I were to change my name
20:24
to a single character such as B this would still be true if our string variable was empty there
20:31
were no characters within it that would actually give us false we could use this to check to see
20:37
if somebody enters in their name or not if somebody types in their name then we type cast it to a boolean if somebody
20:44
skips entering in their name that would return false we could reprompt the user
20:49
to enter in their name again all right everybody so that is type casting it is the process of converting a variable
20:56
from one data type to another this is especially useful with handling user
21:01
input because user input is always a string there may be at times where we want to convert it to an integer a float
21:08
or a boolean and well everybody that is type casting in
21:14
Python all right everybody in this topic I'm going to show you how we can accept user input in Python we use the input
4.user input ⌨️
21:21
function it's a function that prompts the user to enter in data and it returns
21:26
the enter data as a string here's an example to accept user input we will
21:31
call the input function when I run this program we need to enter in data to our
21:37
console window like so then hit enter however we
21:42
need a prompt we need to tell the user what we want them to type in so let's ask a
21:48
question our prompt will be within quotes let's say "What is your
21:57
name?" Let's try this again what is your name i can type in something why don't
22:02
you go ahead and type in your full name then hit enter now with this input we're not
22:09
quite doing anything with it the input function is going to return some data as a string we can assign it to a variable
22:16
if we would like let's create a variable of name name equals our user
22:23
input then once we have our name let's print a message i'll use an fstring we
22:30
will print hello add a placeholder then insert our name variable within that
22:36
placeholder let's try this what is your name type in your name
22:42
hit enter hello whatever your name is let's try a different name i will pick
22:48
Spongebob many people are familiar with Spongebob hello Spongebob this time we will ask a user
22:56
how old they are let's assign a variable of age equals accept some user input we
23:03
need a prompt within quotes how old are you
23:10
once we have our age variable let's print I'll use an f string you are add a
23:18
placeholder our variable age years
23:24
old what is your name type in your name how old are you let's say that I'm
23:32
25 hello whatever your name is you are whatever your age is years old
23:40
all right so let's say that it's our birthday before we print our age variable let's
23:46
say happy birthday since I'm not inserting any
23:52
variables within this print statement this doesn't need to be an F string
23:58
you'll want to use an F string if you want to insert variables before we display the user's
24:03
age let's take the user's age and increase it by one we could say age
24:08
equals age + one but there's one problem with
24:14
this type in a name how old are you type in an
24:20
age and we have a problem we have a type error can only concatenate strings not
24:27
integers to strings when we accept user input we store that input as a string before we
24:35
increment our age by one we'll need to convert it to an integer we can't normally use strings within arithmetic
24:42
expressions but we can do that with integers and floats though after we accept some user input for our age
24:49
variable we could take our age variable and type cast it as an integer which we
24:56
talked about in the previous lesson so let's say age equals our age after we
25:02
type cast it then increment it by one so type in your
25:08
name type in an age and we get this message hello your
25:14
name happy birthday you are whatever your age is years
25:19
old so strings we can't normally use with arithmetic expressions we would
25:24
have to type cast it to an integer or a float however we could condense some of these steps we're taking up an extra
25:32
line to type cast our age as an integer what we could do instead is that when we
25:37
accept our user input we can enclose the input function within a type cast to int
25:44
and that would work the same type in your name type in an age and this works the
25:52
same and it takes less lines of code and is more readable i would say when we
25:57
accept user input it returns that input as a string data type then we just have
26:02
to type cast it to another data type if we need to and in this case for age we do now we'll go over a couple exercises
26:10
because it's important to practice what you've learned in this first exercise we're
26:15
going to calculate the area of a rectangle we need to prompt the user to enter in a length and the width of a
26:21
rectangle so we will create a variable of length we will accept some user input using the
26:28
input function what is our prompt let's say enter the
26:35
length let's do this with width i'll just copy and paste what we have width
26:42
equals enter the width so we have the length and the
26:47
width to get the area of a rectangle we have to multiply the length by the width
26:52
so let's say area equals our length variable now to use multiplication you
26:59
use an asterisk we'll discuss different arithmetic operators in the next lesson so we have length time width that is the
27:08
area i'm going to print our area because I need to test something enter the
27:15
length let's say five 5 in 5 cm doesn't matter enter the width six we get a type
27:23
error can't multiply sequence by non-int non- integer of type string when we
27:30
accept user input it returns a value of the string data type we can't use those
27:35
strings in arithmetic expressions we're multiplying the length times the width
27:41
we would need to type cast them as an integer or a float since we're working with basic geometry such as calculating
27:48
the area let's do float so let's type cast our user input as a float for both
27:54
length and width okay let's try this again let's
28:03
say 5 * 6 the area that's returned to us is 30
28:08
30.0 this result contains a decimal it's a floating point number a
28:14
float so when we print the area I'll use an f string this time the area is I'll
28:22
add a placeholder display our area variable let's add a unit of measurement
28:28
afterwards i'll pick centimeters now since we're working with areas if we would like to technically be accurate so
28:35
we could say to the power of two or we could add a superscript so if you would
28:40
like superscript 2 and you're on Windows make sure num lock is on hold alt then
28:46
type on the numpad 0178 so we have a superscript of two
28:53
again it's not really necessary for this lesson i just think it'd be cool to include it because then it's technically
29:00
accurate all right let's say that the length is 6.1 and the width is 7.2
29:08
the area is 43.92 cm squared because we're working
29:14
with areas let's cover a second exercise this time we will create a shopping cart
29:20
program exercise two we're going to create a shopping cart program we need three variables an item a price and a
29:28
quantity of those items we will create a variable of item
29:34
we will accept some user input what item would you like to
29:42
buy what are we trying to purchase we'll keep the data type of the user input as
29:47
a string then we need a price what is the price of each item we're buying use the
29:54
input function what is the
30:00
price a price should be a floatingoint number for example we might have dollars
30:05
and cents we need a decimal so let's type cast our input as a float then a
30:13
quantity we will accept some user input our prompt will be how
30:21
many would you like quantities they should be whole
30:28
numbers let's type cast our input as an integer then we will have a total what's
30:35
the total that we have to pay so let's take the price of each item use an
30:41
asterisk for multiply our quantity then let's do a test run let's
30:48
print our total what item would you like to buy let's say a pizza what is the price
30:57
$10.99 how many would you like i would like five pizzas and our total is
31:07
54.95 let's say that before we display the total let's print the following i'll
31:12
use an F string you have bought insert a placeholder display our
31:20
quantity X item or items i'll add slash
31:28
S then we will print I'll use an F string again your total
31:36
is display our total what item would you like to buy i
31:42
would like to buy a pizza what is the price $10.99 how many would you like i would
31:49
like nine pizzas they're all for me i'm going to eat all of them you have bought 9 x pizzas your
31:58
total is 98.91 let's add a unit of currency before this
32:04
pick unit of currency before displaying the total i'll pick American
32:09
dollars i would like to buy pizza what is the price
32:15
$9.99 how many would you like i would like a dozen pizzas
32:20
12 you have bought 12 x pizzas your total is
32:28
$119.88 all right everybody that is how to accept user input in Python and we've covered a few exercises in the next
32:35
topic we're going to create a Mad Libs game and that is how to accept user input in
32:41
Python all right everybody in this video we're going to create a game of Mad Libs not because we have to but because I
5.madlibs game
32:48
want to it would be a good exercise for us just so we're more comfortable with accepting user input if you're not
32:53
familiar with Mad Libs Mad Libs is a word game where you create a story by filling in the blanks with random words
33:01
so we're going to create a story template the story is going to be missing some components we will fill in
33:07
those components with random words that we type in here's a story that I've written myself print use an F string
33:16
today I went to a insert a placeholder
33:21
zoo for our placeholder we'll insert an adjective we'll insert a variable named
33:29
adjective adjective adjective one you're going to get an English lesson today too
33:35
an adjective is a description of something so for our zoo adjective one
33:40
could be expensive large dirty an adjective describe
33:48
something we'll fill this in when we accept user input for our second print statement let's
33:54
print the following in an exhibit I saw a placeholder we'll
34:05
include a noun noun one a noun is a person place or thing in English maybe a
34:12
gorilla a gorilla named Harambe for example print use an F string let's say
34:21
our noun one whatever this is we can reuse variables
34:27
was we will create a second adjective adjective 2 we will be describing
34:34
whatever noun one is this person place or thing and we will insert a verb verb
34:42
one a verb is an action such as running or eating then for our last statement
34:50
let's print I was add a placeholder we'll create adjective
34:57
three adjective 3 will describe us now we're going to fill in these variables
35:03
by accepting user input we're going to fill in adjective one we'll accept user input using the
35:10
input function enter an adjective
35:16
i'm going to add a reminder that an adjective is a description of
35:24
something then we need noun one noun one equals
35:30
input enter a noun a noun is a person
35:35
place or thing then we have adjective two i'll
35:41
just copy adjective one paste it change one to two then a verb verb one equals
35:51
input enter a verb i want verb one to be in current tense i'll ask the user to
35:59
end the verb with ing enter a verb ending with
36:06
ing then it's current tense our person place or thing of noun one is currently
36:12
doing something such as eating and then adjective three and I'll
36:18
just copy one of these adjectives adjective 3 equals input
36:23
enter an adjective okay and then we are ready to run this enter an adjective an
36:29
adjective describes something i will say
36:34
suspicious or some kids like to say sussy or sus even i've also heard of
36:40
kids nowadays using the word skipy feel free to type in whatever you would like
36:46
it is your story after all i'm going to say suspicious enter a noun a person place
36:53
or thing i like to poke fun at Mark Zuckerberg so I'm going to say my person
36:59
is Mark Zuckerberg enter an adjective that is a
37:05
description angry enter a verb ending with ing so
37:11
it's current tense uh screeching enter an adjective
37:19
happy here's my story today I went to a suspicious zoo in an exhibit i saw a
37:27
Mark Zuckerberg mark Zuckerberg was angry and screeching i was happy that's our game
37:35
of Mad Libs it's a word game where you create a story by filling in the blanks with random words also post the output
37:43
of your Mad Libs game in the comment section down below because I really want to read them i want to see what you guys
37:48
came up with and well everybody that is a Mad Libs game using
6.arithmetic & math
37:55
Python hey everybody in this video I'm going to show you all of the different math that we'll need throughout the rest
38:01
of the series i have a lot to cover and I'll split this video into different sections we'll cover some basic
38:07
arithmetic operators built-in math functions a few functions from the math
38:12
module and then a few exercises be sure to look at the timestamps if you would like to skip ahead to another section
38:18
let's begin with some really easy stuff we're going to cover some basic arithmetic operators let's say we have a
38:24
variable friends currently you have zero friends
38:29
if you need to increment a variable by one you could say friends the name of
38:35
the variable equals the name of the variable again + 1 so the plus sign is
38:41
the addition operator and I think we do have a little bit of experience with that already so if I were to print my
38:47
variable friends guess what you now have one friend we could also shorten this line
38:54
of code you could say friends plus equals 1
39:01
that would do the same thing this is known as an augmented assignment
39:06
operator that will give you the same result i prefer to use augmented assignment operators just because they
39:12
take less text and I think they're easier to read now let's use subtraction friends equals
39:20
friends minus 2 so of course minus is the subtraction operator uh you have -2
39:26
friends i guess if you were to use the augmented assignment operator that would be friends minus equals
39:34
2 there you still have -2 friends okay multiplication let's change friends
39:41
to how about five friends equals friends
39:47
time 3 you now have 15 friends then the
39:52
augmented assignment operator version of this would be friends time=
40:01
3 so again you have 15 friends let's cover
40:07
division friends equals friends divided
40:12
by two so we have 2.5 friends somebody was
40:18
cut in half we have half a friend maybe it's just their legs or torso or something then the augmented assignment
40:24
operator would be friends / equals 2 and the result is
40:31
still the same now exponents friends equals friends to
40:39
the power of two so friends is currently five friends to the power of two would
40:45
be 5 * 5 which is 25
40:51
the augmented assignment operator version of this equation would be friends exponent equals
41:00
2 and again friends is 25 then we have modulus modulus gives
41:06
you the remainder of any division suppose we have 10 friends instead of five i will assign a new variable
41:14
remainder remainder equals friends the percent sign is known as the modulus
41:20
operator it will give us the remainder of any division if I were to divide my group of friends by three we will have
41:27
one remaining i'll store the remainder within a separate variable we would have a remainder of one it's kind of like in
41:34
class when the teacher says for everybody in the class to go into groups of three then there's always that one
41:39
kid that's by themselves that's kind of the same concept we're dividing our friends into groups of three then the
41:46
modulus will give you the remainder if we divided our group of friends into groups of two well 10 divides by two
41:53
evenly so there is no remainder so that is the modulus operator it's fairly
41:58
popular to use this operator to find if a number is even or odd because it will divide by two evenly if that number is
42:04
even if the remainder is one that means that the original number is odd okay so yeah those are some basic arithmetic
42:11
operators addition subtraction multiplication division exponentiation then
42:18
modulus now what we're going to do is cover some built-in math related functions suppose we have three
42:24
variables x= 3.14 y =
42:30
4 z = 5 it doesn't matter if these are floating point numbers or whole integers
42:37
the first is the round function we have a variable named result i'm going to
42:42
round x so there is a built-in round function
42:47
after the set of parenthesis we can add some value or variable to be rounded so
42:53
we will round x to the nearest whole integer then print the result so our
43:00
result is three so that's the round function with the absolute value
43:07
function we can find the absolute value of a number uh let's change y to be -4
43:13
instead of four we'll take result equals abs which
43:19
means absolute value of y the absolute value is the distance away from zero as
43:25
a whole number the absolute value of -4 is
43:31
4 let's change y back to
43:36
four there's a built-in power function result equals
43:43
pow then we'll need a base and an exponent what's y to the power of
43:51
3 that would be 4 * 4 * 4 which is 64
43:56
that's the power function you can raise a base to a given power the next two are really useful
44:04
using the max function we can find the maximum value of various values what's
44:10
the maximum value between x y and z then I'll just need to store this value uh
44:18
results equals the max between x y and z well the maximum value is
44:25
five otherwise there's
44:31
min what's the minimum value between X Y and Z that would be
44:38
3.14 now in this next section we do have some very useful constants and functions from the math class but we'll need to
44:45
import the math module at the top of our text editor so import math if you need
44:52
the value of pi you'll type the name of the math
44:57
module.py and I'm just going to print this print
45:02
math.py the value of pi is 3.14159 and a bunch of digits that come
45:09
after if you're working with physics I do know that people use the constant e a
45:14
lot we won't be using e in this video series but if you ever need access to it just type math e and that will give you
45:22
e which is 2.71 something something something i believe e is known as the
45:28
exponential constant if you need the square root of a number let's say result
45:35
equals math sqrt we can place a variable or a value
45:42
within the square root function uh let's say we have x again x= 9 what is the square root of x then I
45:51
will print whatever the result is the square root of 9 is three that is
45:58
the square root function there's a ceiling function
46:04
result equals math dot seal seal will always round a
46:11
floatingoint number up suppose x is 9.1 so 9.1 rounded up is
46:20
10 otherwise there's floor which will always round a number down result equals
46:27
math.f floor let's change x to 9.9 9.9 rounded down is 9 those are some
46:37
useful math functions let's go over some exercises okay this first exercise we
46:42
are going to calculate the circumference of a circle we'll need the help of the math module because there's some good
46:49
functions in there to calculate the circumference of a circle the formula is
46:55
2 * * r let's ask a user for a radius because that's what r is we'll
47:02
accept some user input enter the radius of a
47:10
circle we will type cast the input as a floatingoint
47:16
number to calculate the circumference again the equation is 2 * pi we can get
47:26
that from the math module times whatever the radius is and the user is going to
47:32
type that in then we will print whatever the circumference is print we'll use an fstring
47:40
the circumference is our variable circumference
47:48
enter the radius of a circle i'll enter 10 actually 10.5 their circumference is
47:57
65.97 if you want to round and truncate some of these numbers we can use the round function round
48:04
circumference then round to a given decimal place i'll round to two
48:09
digits again 10.5 rounded is 65.97 you could add a unit of
48:16
measurement too let's say centimeters 10.5 is 65.97 cm all right that is the first
48:25
exercise for this next exercise let's calculate the area of a circle we'll
48:30
import the math module we'll ask for a radius much like before radius equals
48:40
input enter the radius of a circle
48:46
we'll cast our input as a floatingoint number the equation for the area of a
48:53
circle is pi time radius squared we could easily
49:01
use the built-in power function to raise our radius to the power of two then we
49:07
will display the area print i'm using an F string the
49:14
area of the circle is our area to some unit of measurement
49:22
let's say centime squared enter the radius of a circle
49:29
10.5 the area of the circle is 346.36 but I would like to round this
49:35
number to two decimal places i'll use that round function and I'll place area and the
49:43
number of digits to round to within this function let's try that again
49:48
10.5 the area of the circle is 346.36 cm squared that is the second
49:56
exercise for this last program we're going to find the hypotenuse of a right triangle the formula to calculate the
50:04
hypotenuse of a right angle triangle is C equ= the square of A^2 + B^2
50:12
we'll begin by importing the math module we'll ask the user for the lengths of
50:17
side A and B a equals
50:24
input enter side A we'll cast the input as a floatingoint
50:32
number we'll do the same thing with side B b
50:40
equals enter side B now this part's going to be confusing
50:46
we'll calculate C we'll need A^2 + B ^ 2 we'll take A to the^ of 2
50:56
plus B to the^ of 2 then we'll need the square root of all
51:02
of this whatever the result is I will surround this equation with math square
51:10
root and that should give us our answer let's
51:16
print using an F string side C
51:22
equals whatever C is so enter side A three side B will be
51:30
four side C is five all right everybody so that was everything related to some
51:36
arithmetic operators and math related functions in Python and in the next video we're going to cover a few things
51:42
involving string [Music] formatting hey everybody in this topic
7.if statements
51:48
I'm going to explain if statements an if statement is used to do some code only
51:53
if some condition we set is true else we could do something else it's a basic
51:58
form of decision-m if it's true we do something if it's not true we don't do it let's ask a user for their age age
52:07
equals input enter your age i will type cast
52:13
the input as an integer depending on what the user's age
52:18
is we can do one of a few things let's pretend that the user would like to sign up for a credit card but in order to do
52:25
so their age needs to be greater than or equal to 18 well we can check that to
52:30
use an if statement type if then some condition what would we like to check
52:36
let's check to see if the user's age is greater than or equal to 18 then add a
52:43
colon then hit enter any code underneath the if statement should be indented make
52:48
sure to pay attention to that because that's easy to miss if the user's age is greater than or equal to 18 let's print
52:56
you are now signed up if I were to run this code I'll type
53:03
in my age i'll type 21 hit enter this statement is true therefore we will
53:09
execute any code found within the if statement you are now signed up what if this condition was not
53:16
true let's say my age is 13 well nothing happens if the condition we check is
53:23
instead false we skip over this code if you need to take a different course of
53:28
action you could add an else statement if this is true do this else
53:36
we can do something else let's print a different message you must be 18 plus to sign
53:46
up i'll type in my age again i'll say that I'm 13 hit enter you must be 18
53:53
plus to sign up that's basically an if statement do some code only if some
53:59
condition is true else you can do something else entirely it's a basic form of decisionm the else statement is
54:06
kind of like a last resort we can check more than one condition before reaching the else statement we can add an else if
54:14
statement which we just shortened to e l i if meaning else if else if let's check
54:22
if age is less than zero then we'll print a different
54:28
message you haven't been born
54:34
yet now if I run this code I'll say that my age is negative one
54:41
this condition is false we skip this code this condition is true therefore we
54:47
will execute this code and we skip the else statement you haven't been born yet
54:53
let's add another else if statement you can add as many else if statements as you want let's check to see if
54:59
somebody's age is greater than or equal to 100 we'll print a different message
55:05
let's print you are too old to sign
55:11
up if I were to say my age is 111 years
55:16
old well it states you are now signed up the reason that we didn't reach this part of our else if statement that's
55:24
because this condition is still technically true you do need to pay attention to your order of if and else
55:30
if statements if I want to be sure that nobody over 100 is signing up I should
55:36
probably move this to the beginning if age is greater than or
55:42
equal to 100 then else if age is greater than or equal to 18 we'll do something
55:50
else enter your age i am 111 years old you are too old to sign up so those are
55:56
if statements if some condition is true do something else if you can check
56:01
something else if no above conditions are true you could do something else entirely it's kind of like the default
56:09
here's another example we'll ask a user if they would like some food response
56:15
equals input would you like
56:21
food we'll have the user type in Y for yes or N for no
56:32
if our response now to check to see if two values are equal you would use double
56:39
equals if the response is equal to y
56:44
then we will print have some
56:50
food the doubles equal sign is the comparison operator it will check to see
56:55
if two values are equal you don't want one equals because that's the assignment operator python in this case thinks
57:02
we're attempting to assign the character y to response so for comparisons use
57:08
double equals else we can
57:15
print no food for you so would you like food i'll type y
57:23
have some food let's try it again i'll type no and
57:28
for no no food for you here's a third example we'll have a
57:34
user type in their name name equals input enter your
57:42
name if our name is equal to an empty
57:47
string that means they didn't type in anything so let's yell at the user
57:53
you did not type in your
58:00
name else we will print using an fstring hello whatever the name
58:09
is enter your name i'm just going to hit enter you did not type in your name
58:15
let's run this again i'll type in my name and we have executed the else
58:20
statement this time hello bro so one important thing that you
58:25
should know is the use of booleans with if statements suppose we have some
58:30
boolean variable named for sale i'll set this to be true now using an if
58:36
statement you can just use the boolean variable in place of a condition because a condition would evaluate to be true or
58:44
false we could just say if for sale if that's
58:50
true then let's print this item is for
58:58
sale else we will print this item is not for sale for sale
59:08
is set to be true this item is for sale if this variable were
59:15
false well then the item is not for sale let's try a different variable how about
59:22
online if online the user is online else the user
59:33
is offline so the user is
59:39
offline i'll change the boolean to true the user is
59:44
online so with if statements you can either write a condition or you could use a
59:49
boolean all right everybody so those are if statements do some code only if some
59:55
condition is true else you can do something else it's a basic form of
1:00:00
decision-m and those are if statements in Python hey everybody this is a remake of
8.calculator program
1:00:08
my Python calculator program for absolute beginners all you need to know to complete this exercise is just if
1:00:14
statements and how they work so let's get started for this exercise a user is going to select an arithmetic operator
1:00:21
operator equals input we will ask the user to enter an
1:00:28
operator this will be plus for addition minus for subtraction asterisk for
1:00:34
multiplication and a forward slash for division you could enter more than this but I don't want to make this exercise
1:00:40
too complicated we will create a variable of num one to contain our first number let's say we would like to add
1:00:47
two numbers together what is the first number going to be enter the first
1:00:55
number and let's do this with the second number num two enter the second
1:01:04
number let me show you something i'm going to add num one and num two
1:01:09
together num one plus num two we'll do a test run enter an operator i would like to
1:01:17
use addition enter the first number 10 and 11 well the result is
1:01:25
1,1 when we accept user input they are string data types what we've ended up
1:01:30
doing is string concatenation we've concatenated the string of 11 to 10
1:01:36
that's why we ended up with 1,1 we'll have to convert these two strings to be
1:01:41
floating point numbers by type casting them as a
1:01:49
float so enclose your input functions with a type cast a float and now we
1:01:55
should be able to add those two numbers together so let's add 10 and 11 and we
1:02:01
get 21.0 0 depending on the operator that the user selects we'll use some if
1:02:06
statements to determine that we will check if our operator variable is equal
1:02:12
to a character of plus and for now I'll write pass as a
1:02:18
placeholder we'll get back to this later else if our operator is equal to minus we will use
1:02:28
subtraction and for now I'll write pass else if operator is equal to an asterisk
1:02:35
for multiplication we will multiply else if our operator is equal
1:02:42
to a forward slash for division we will divide if our operator is addition let's
1:02:50
create a variable of result result equals num 1 + num
1:02:57
2 for subtraction it's going to be num 1 minus
1:03:03
num 2 multiplication would be num 1 * num
1:03:09
2 then division would be num 1 / num 2
1:03:15
then we just have to print the result print our result be sure to do this with each of
1:03:22
the else if statements as well and let's see what we have
1:03:27
let's add 5.5 +
1:03:33
6.9 that gives us 12.4 let's subtract
1:03:39
420 minus 0.69 that gives us
1:03:45
419.31 let's test multiplication multiply
1:03:50
3.14 times 3.14 which gives us 9.8596
1:03:56
8596 then division let's divide 69 by
1:04:05
13 and that gives us a really long number so you could round a number if
1:04:10
you would like we would enclose our result within the round
1:04:16
function and we'll just update each of these print statements this will round to the
1:04:23
nearest whole integer so let's divide 420 by
1:04:28
13 let's say that we would like three digits after the decimal within the
1:04:34
round function we could add comma 3 for three decimal
1:04:39
places enter operator let's use division divide 420 by
1:04:47
69 so that gives me 6.087 so we can round to a given digit
1:04:54
after a decimal in this case three places what if somebody types in an
1:04:59
operator that doesn't exist like the word pizza then I will divide two
1:05:05
numbers well let's add an else statement if somebody selects some input that is
1:05:10
invalid let's let them know i'll use an fring
1:05:16
let's say that the operator that the user has selected is not valid and let's try this
1:05:24
again enter an operator pizza enter the first number 420 and
1:05:31
69 pizza is not valid let's say is not a valid operator instead that makes more
1:05:39
sense pizza will be my operator first number is 420 second number is
1:05:47
69 pizza is not a valid operator all right everybody so that is
1:05:52
a very simple Python calculator program you can make as a
1:05:58
beginner hey there it's me again in today's topic we're going to create a weight converter program in Python this
9.weight conversion program 🏋️
1:06:06
is an exercise that will follow up the lesson on if statements we'll convert pounds to kilog or kilog to pound the
1:06:13
user is going to decide we will begin by creating a weight variable we will assign some user
1:06:19
input enter your weight we will convert this input into a
1:06:25
floatingoint number so add that cast then we will ask for a unit is this weight in kilogram or
1:06:34
pounds input kilogram
1:06:39
or pounds we want the user to type in either K for
1:06:45
kilogram or L for pounds and these are capital letters by the
1:06:51
way using an if statement let's first check to see if our unit is equal to a
1:06:57
capital K that means the current weight is in kilogram we need to convert that
1:07:03
weight to pounds let's reassign weight equal
1:07:09
to our weight times
1:07:15
2.205 else if unit is equal to L we need
1:07:21
to convert to kilogram weight equals weight divided by
1:07:29
2.205 else the user did not type in something that was valid let's
1:07:34
print using an fstring unit was not
1:07:42
valid at the end of our program we will print the new weight i'll use an
1:07:48
fstring your weight is our new weight after it's reassigned
1:07:56
now we need a unit of measurement this is what I'm thinking we'll do within our if and else if statements let's reassign
1:08:03
our unit we're reassigning unit to be lbs for
1:08:10
pounds else if unit equals kgs for
1:08:17
kilogram in our results we will display our new unit let's take a look enter
1:08:24
your weight actually I'm just going to make one change i'm going to add colon space there that's much better
1:08:32
enter your weight let's say I'm 180 lb this is in
1:08:38
pounds i'll type capital L your weight in kilog is
1:08:44
81.63 i think I'm going to round this i will enclose the weight variable within
1:08:49
a round function we will round to one decimal place let's try this again enter your
1:08:56
weight maybe I'm 81 kg i'll type k for kilogram
1:09:02
your weight is 178.6 lb let's make sure that this else statement works too enter
1:09:10
your weight 180 pizzas pizzas was not valid so we're
1:09:16
still displaying our output we would want to avoid that if somebody doesn't type in a valid unit so let's cut this
1:09:25
line then paste each within the if and else if statements when we exit the else
1:09:31
statement we're not printing the output so let's make sure that this works enter your weight i am 180
1:09:41
pizzas pizza was not valid all right everybody well that is a
1:09:46
weight converter program in Python i thought this would be a helpful exercise now that we have finished the section on
1:09:52
if statements and yeah that is a weight converter program in Python
10.temperature conversion program 🌡️
1:09:59
hey everybody in this topic we're going to create a temperature conversion program as an exercise we'll begin by
1:10:05
asking what the current unit of measurement is unit equals will accept some user
1:10:13
input is this temperature
1:10:19
in Celsius or Fahrenheit
1:10:29
c slashF then we will ask for the
1:10:34
temperature i'll store the temperature in a variable named temp meaning temperature temp equals
1:10:42
input enter the temperature then we should cast our user
1:10:49
input as a floatingoint number if unit is equal to
1:10:59
C I'll fill this in momentarily i'm just going to write pass as a
1:11:05
placeholder else if unit is equal to F we will do something
1:11:13
else else let's print something just an error message of some sort using an F
1:11:19
string unit is an invalid unit of
1:11:29
measurement let's test this else statement is the temperature in Celsius
1:11:35
or Fahrenheit what if I were to type K for Kelvin i'll make up some temperature like 100 k is an invalid unit of
1:11:43
measurement all right we know the else statement works let's convert Fahrenheit to Celsius using this formula we will
1:11:50
take our temperature equals 9 * our
1:11:58
temp / 5 + 32 i'll take all of this and use the
1:12:05
round function we'll round to one decimal place then we will print the current
1:12:12
temperature in Fahrenheit i'll use an F string the
1:12:20
Temperature in Fahrenheit is our temp
1:12:27
variable degrees Fahrenheit let's test this if
1:12:33
statement is the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit it is currently in Celsius what is 33° in Celsius converted
1:12:42
to Fahrenheit the temperature in Fahrenheit is 91.4°
1:12:48
all right so this section is working let's work on the else statement else if our unit is currently in Fahrenheit
1:12:55
we'll convert to Celsius that formula is temp
1:13:02
equals our temperature minus 32 * 5 /
1:13:09
9 then I will round the result to one decimal place
1:13:18
then we'll print the temperature in Celsius the temperature in Celsius is
1:13:26
temp° C for Celsius is the temperature in Celsius or
1:13:32
Fahrenheit it is currently in Fahrenheit enter the temperature
1:13:40
91.4 the temperature in Celsius is 33.0°
1:13:46
well everybody that is a simple temperature conversion program in
1:13:57
Python all right people we're talking about logical operators today logical operators allow us to evaluate multiple
11.logical operators 🌦️
1:14:04
conditions we can link them together there's three we'll discuss or and not
1:14:11
we'll begin with or with or we can check more than one condition if at least one
1:14:16
of those conditions is true then the entire statement is true here's an example let's say we have an outdoor
1:14:23
event and I will create two variables one temp meaning temperature let's say that this is in
1:14:30
Celsius 25° C pick Fahrenheit if you would like and I will create a boolean
1:14:36
variable of is raining i will set that to be false it is currently not raining
1:14:42
if the temperature is too hot too cold or it's raining then I will cancel this
1:14:48
outdoor event we'll write an if statement to check that if our temp
1:14:53
short for temperature is greater than let's say 35 35° C then I'll use the or
1:15:02
logical operator or if our temp is less than
1:15:07
zero or if is raining is
1:15:12
true if one of these conditions is true we're going to cancel our outdoor event
1:15:19
so let's print the following the outdoor event is
1:15:27
cancelled else we will print something else the outdoor
1:15:34
event is still scheduled the temperature is reasonable
1:15:42
and is raining is false it's not raining so we print the else clause the
1:15:49
outdoor event is still scheduled what if the temperature was really hot like
1:15:58
36° well the outdoor event is cancelled what if it's cold
1:16:05
-5° the outdoor event is canled this condition was true therefore we execute
1:16:11
the if statement or what if the temperature is reasonable but it's raining is raining is true
1:16:18
well then the outdoor event is still canled so with the or logical operator
1:16:24
at least one of these conditions needs to be true if one of these conditions is true you could consider the entire
1:16:30
statement true now let's cover and with and we can link two conditions together both
1:16:37
conditions must be true in order for that entire statement to be true so
1:16:42
again let's say we have temp short for temperature and we have a boolean variable of is sunny i will set that to
1:16:50
be true we will check if our temp is greater than or equal to
1:16:59
28° and is it sunny is sunny if it's hot and if it's sunny if
1:17:08
this is true let's print the following it is hot
1:17:14
outside for fun I'm going to add an emoji but you don't have to i just think
1:17:20
it's more entertaining that way but you do you and I will
1:17:26
print it is sunny sometimes these emojis are
1:17:33
formatted differently i'm just going to copy it from somewhere else that's better currently the temperature is 25
1:17:39
25° C and it's sunny this condition was false but this one is true with the and
1:17:45
logical operator both conditions must be true in order for us to execute this block of code if our temperature was
1:17:55
30° well then both conditions are true it is hot outside and it is sunny
1:18:02
let's write a few more let's add else if else if the temp is less than or equal
1:18:10
to zero and is sunny we will print something
1:18:16
else it is cold outside i'll change the
1:18:23
emoji and it is sunny let's set the temperature to be5°
1:18:31
it is cold outside and it is sunny both these conditions are true so
1:18:37
we do this instead you can link as many conditions together as you would like let's see if
1:18:43
our temperature is within a certain range else if temp is less than 28 and
1:18:51
our temp is greater than zero and is
1:18:58
sunny to check to see if something is within a certain range there is a shortcut too pycharm is recommending
1:19:04
this we can simplify chain comparisons so this effectively does the same thing if 28 is greater than our
1:19:13
temp and our temp is greater than zero and it's sunny then we will print it is
1:19:20
warm outside rather than
1:19:27
hot and it's still sunny so let's say our temperature is 20° C and it's
1:19:34
sunny it is warm outside and it is sunny now we have the not logical
1:19:41
operator it inverts the condition we are checking to see if something is either not false or not true so let's check to
1:19:50
see if it's not sunny really I'll just copy what we have and paste it
1:19:58
else if not is
1:20:03
sunny then that means it's
1:20:12
cloudy and let's use a cloud
1:20:19
emoji so basically not does the opposite of what you're looking for we are checking if not is sunny is sunny is
1:20:27
false then this condition is true okay let's say our temp is
1:20:33
28 is sunny is now false it is hot outside it is cloudy
1:20:41
what if our temperature was zero it is cold outside it is cloudy
1:20:48
what if the temperature was reasonable like 20° it is warm outside it is cloudy so not
1:20:56
it inverts the condition if it's true it's now false if it's false it's now
1:21:02
true all right everybody so those are logical operators they allow us to evaluate multiple conditions with or at
1:21:10
least one condition must be true with and both conditions must be true and not
1:21:16
not does the opposite it inverts the condition we check if something is not false or not true and well everybody
1:21:24
those are logical operators in Python hey everybody so today I got to
12.conditional expressions
1:21:30
explain conditional expressions in Python a conditional expression is a oneline shortcut for using an if else
1:21:38
statement if you're familiar with other programming languages this is also known as the trinary operator it behaves
1:21:44
similarly using conditional expressions we can print or assign one of two values
1:21:50
based on a condition here's the formula return X if our condition is true else
1:21:56
return Y here's a basic example we will create a variable for number just num
1:22:02
let's say our number is five i'm going to print then within our print statement
1:22:08
I will write a conditional expression following this formula i'll just copy and paste it let's check to see if our
1:22:15
number is positive let's print the text positive if our condition what are we
1:22:22
checking let's check to see if num is greater than zero that means it's
1:22:28
positive if this condition is false we will instead print whatever comes after
1:22:33
else else negative number is five that will
1:22:39
print positive if our number was neg 5 well this condition would be false we
1:22:44
would instead print negative let's go over another let's check to see if our
1:22:50
number is even or odd let's set num to be six this time I will assign the result
1:22:57
to a variable our result equals take our
1:23:04
formula let's assign even
1:23:09
if our num modulus 2 is our number divisible by
1:23:16
two does that equal zero else return odd
1:23:21
then let's print our result r
1:23:27
result number is six that is even if it's five then it's odd
1:23:33
assign even if our number is divisible by two else return
1:23:40
odd let's create variables A and B a will equal 6 b will equal
1:23:50
7 let's create a variable of max num equals follow our formula again
1:24:00
return variable a if a is greater than b else return b between a and b which is
1:24:08
the maximum number that would be b of seven let's find the minimum this
1:24:16
time min num a if a is less than b else
1:24:23
return b the minimum number between 6 and 7 is
1:24:31
This time we'll take an age age equals 25 we will create a variable of status
1:24:37
equals use our formula again return a string of adult if our
1:24:46
age is greater than or equal to 18 else return a string of child then we will
1:24:53
print our status our age is 25 that's greater than or equal to 18 we will
1:24:58
print adult if our age was 13 then we are a child we will instead return
1:25:06
child let's work with the temperature temperature equals 30°
1:25:13
C so that's hot let's create a variable of weather
1:25:19
assign a string of hot if our temperature is greater than 20 else we
1:25:27
will return a string of cold what's the weather outside today based on the
1:25:32
temperature it is hot if our temperature was
1:25:37
20 then the weather is cold okay last
1:25:42
example we will work with a user role i will set this to be admin
1:25:51
we will define a variable of access level equals again follow our
1:26:00
formula return the text of full access
1:26:05
if our condition of user ro is equal to
1:26:11
a string of admin else we will return limited
1:26:19
access our user role is an admin let's print our access level and we have full
1:26:25
access but what if we were a guest well then we have limited access
1:26:31
all right everybody those are conditional expressions they're a oneline shortcut for the if else
1:26:37
statement it's similar to the turnary operator in other programming languages using conditional expressions we can
1:26:44
print or assign one of two values based on a condition you follow the formula of
1:26:50
return x if our condition is true else return y if it's false and well
1:26:56
everybody those are a few examples of conditional expressions in
1:27:02
Python hey everybody in this topic I'm going to cover a few useful string methods that you may be interested in
13.string methods 〰️
1:27:08
then at the end of this video we will work on an exercise where we will validate some user input as we know a
1:27:14
string is just a series of characters let's ask a user for their full name
1:27:20
name equals input enter your full
1:27:29
name the first method I'll show you well technically this is a function the length function will give us the length
1:27:36
of a string how many characters is it we will find the length of our variable name after the user types in some input
1:27:44
this function returns an integer i'll store that result within a variable uh let's just say result then I will print
1:27:52
whatever the result is why don't you go ahead and type in
1:27:57
your full name the length of this string in my
1:28:03
example is eight characters that does include spaces too 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 if
1:28:11
you ever need the length of a string there is the length function let's move on if we were to type our variable name
1:28:18
followed by a dot we have access to a whole bunch of different methods we have
1:28:24
the find method the find method will return the first occurrence of a given
1:28:29
character the position let's find any spaces
1:28:34
i'll store the result within a variable named result i will type in my full
1:28:43
name the first occurrence of a space that's what we set is at position three
1:28:48
when working with indexes we always begin with zero this first character would have an index of zero then 1 2 3
1:28:57
that's why the find method returned three in place of four let's find the first occurrence of a capital
1:29:05
B see it's zero how about
1:29:12
O for me that would be two so remember it's always the first occurrence if you
1:29:18
need the last occurrence there is a different method which is R find r meaning reverse
1:29:27
we will find the last occurrence of an
1:29:33
O that has a position of five 0 1 2 3 4
1:29:39
5 if Python isn't able to locate a given character it will return negative 1
1:29:45
let's find any I don't know uh
1:29:52
Q's python could not find any lowercase Q's the rfind method will return
1:29:57
negative 1 if there are no results we can capitalize the first letter in a string by using the capitalize function
1:30:05
name dot
1:30:10
capitalize this method will return a string i will reassign that to
1:30:15
name then we will print our name capitalized i'll be sure to type in my name all
1:30:23
lowercase since this is all one string only the first letter is capitalized
1:30:29
even though I'm including a first and last name the upper method will take all of the characters in a string then make
1:30:36
them all uppercase follow your variable that contains a string followed
1:30:42
byupper then I will reassign the result to my name variable to overwrite it
1:30:48
enter your full name all of the letters are now uppercase there is also lower to make
1:30:56
all of the characters lowerase name equals name dot
1:31:05
lower yep all the characters are lowercase now the is digit method will
1:31:11
return either true or false if a string contains only digits the result is a
1:31:17
boolean true or false i'll store that within a variable named result then
1:31:22
print result so if I were to type in my full
1:31:27
name is digit returns false there are not only digits within that string if my
1:31:34
string was some combination of alphabetical characters and numbers this method will still return false it only
1:31:41
returns true if my string only contains digits i'll just type in 1 2 3 see
1:31:49
that's true that is the isdigit method otherwise we have is alpha name
1:31:58
is alpha the is alpha method will return a boolean true or false depending if a
1:32:05
string contains only alphabetical characters i'll type in my full name so
1:32:11
the reason that this came up false is because my full name contains a space which is not an alphabetical
1:32:19
character if I typed in my full name excluding any spaces this would now be
1:32:24
true is alpha would also return false if my name contained any sort of digits bro
1:32:30
1 2 3 and that is also false that is the is alpha method
1:32:37
now let's ask for a phone number phone number equals
1:32:46
input enter your phone number with the phone number they
1:32:52
typically contain dashes let's count how many dashes are going to be in somebody's phone
1:32:58
number phone number dot count method let's count the amount
1:33:05
of dashes so place a character within the count method this method will return
1:33:12
an integer let's store that within a variable result equals phone number
1:33:18
method so type in some phone number 1-23
1:33:25
4-56- 8901 we have three dashes within the
1:33:30
string 1 2 3 that is the count method we can count how many characters are within
1:33:37
a string we also have the replace method honestly the replace method is probably
1:33:44
one of the most useful methods of strings we can replace any occurrence with one character with another replace
1:33:52
let's replace any dashes with maybe a space this method
1:33:58
will return a new string i'm going to reassign this to our phone number variable
1:34:04
then print the phone number enter your phone number
1:34:12
1-234-567-8901 so here's my new phone number but we've replaced all of the dashes with spaces even better yet we
1:34:19
could eliminate all the dashes completely by replacing the dashes or another character with an empty string
1:34:33
1-234-567-8901 here's our new phone number without any dashes we've replaced all dashes with an empty string no
1:34:40
characters if you would like a comprehensive list of all of the string methods available to you you can use the
1:34:46
help function type in the data type string string then I will print whatever
1:34:52
the result is
1:34:57
here's a bunch of methods you might be interested in in the future capitalize case fold center count encode ends with
1:35:07
just to name a few all right everybody here's an exercise for you we will
1:35:12
validate some user input we would like a user to enter in a valid username
1:35:18
however there's a couple of rules the username can be no more than 12 characters long the username must not
1:35:26
contain any spaces and the username must not contain any
1:35:31
digits let's assign a variable named username equals
1:35:37
input enter a user name first let's check to see if our
1:35:45
user input is more than 12 characters long we can do that using the length
1:35:50
function we will find the length of our username the length function returns an
1:35:56
integer let's check to see if the length of our username is greater than 12
1:36:03
characters if it is we'll print a message your
1:36:10
username can't be more than 12 characters
1:36:18
else we will print using an fstring welcome whatever our username
1:36:25
variable is let's try it i'll type in my first
1:36:31
name last name then add a whole bunch of characters afterwards your username can't be more
1:36:38
than 12 characters let's type in something that's under 12
1:36:45
characters yep and that appears to work okay so we have accomplished task number
1:36:50
one our username can't be more than 12 characters next our username must not
1:36:57
contain any spaces we can use the find method of a
1:37:03
string username.find we will find any spaces
1:37:08
that's a character if no spaces are found this method will return -1
1:37:15
using an else if statement I'll add not if the find
1:37:22
method of username
1:37:29
equals1 if the result is not -1 meaning we found a space we will print your
1:37:39
username can't contain spaces i'll type in my first and last
1:37:47
name you might need to think of something that's underneath 12 characters your username can't contain
1:37:54
spaces so we have accomplished rule number two three username must not
1:38:00
contain digits we can use the is alpha method of
1:38:05
strings the is alpha method returns a boolean if a string only contains
1:38:10
alphabetical characters so let's copy that i'll add another else if statement
1:38:17
not username is
1:38:22
alpha then we will print your
1:38:28
username can't contain numbers i guess
1:38:34
technically is alpha would check for spaces too but I'd rather have that be handled within a different if statement
1:38:42
all right I'll type in a username i'll include some digits your username can't contain
1:38:50
numbers all right I think we've accomplished this let me make up a username following these three rules yep
1:39:00
it seems to check out all right everybody and that is a few useful string methods that you may be
1:39:05
interested in hey everybody in this topic I'm going
14.string indexing ✂️
1:39:10
to explain string indexing indexing allows us to access the elements of a
1:39:16
sequence using a set of square brackets also known as the indexing operator
1:39:21
using this set of square brackets following a string there are up to three fields that we can fill in we can access
1:39:28
a starting point in the string an ending point and a step here's an example
1:39:33
suppose we have a credit card number credit number equals and I'll just make
1:39:40
up some number 1 2 3
1:39:45
4-5678-9012 dash 3456 good enough if I need the first character within the
1:39:52
string I can type the name of my string variable followed by the indexing
1:39:57
operator which is a set of square brackets the first position has an index of zero computers always start with zero
1:40:04
so that's why the first index is zero then I'm going to go ahead and print this print credit card number at index
1:40:11
of zero that would be one if I were to change the index to be one 0 1 that
1:40:19
should be two index two would technically be
1:40:25
three then four is the dash within our string as you can see here with the
1:40:30
indexing operator there's up to three fields that we can fill in a start end
1:40:35
and a step if you have just one field listed without any colons it's assumed
1:40:40
you're filling in the starting position so now what if you would like the first four digits of the
1:40:47
string well we would type the name of our string variable indexing operator
1:40:54
we'll need a starting index colon then an ending index the
1:41:00
first four digits would be zero colon 4
1:41:06
then I will print this and I'm just going to turn this
1:41:11
first line into a comment yeah there we go we have the first four digits of our credit card
1:41:16
number 1 2 3 4 just so you know with the ending index this index is exclusive
1:41:23
this first number would be zero 1 2 3 4 so we did not include that dash within
1:41:30
the number the starting index is inclusive the ending index is exclusive
1:41:35
so you can omit the zero in the beginning you could just say colon 4 python assumes the starting position
1:41:42
will be the beginning of the string so that would work too let's get the next
1:41:48
set of digits 5678 credit number indexing operator
1:41:54
let's find where the starting index would be 0 1 2 3 4 5 5 colon 6 7 8
1:42:05
9 then we will print whatever is
1:42:11
here the next set of digits is 5 6 7 8 maybe we need the last 12 digits well
1:42:18
what we could do in that case we will take our string variable credit
1:42:23
number set the starting index to be let's see 0 1 2 3 4
1:42:30
5 5 colon if you need everything up to the end of the string you don't need to
1:42:36
list an ending index just be sure to add that colon python then assumes you need everything up to the end of the
1:42:42
string so I will print whatever we have then we should have everything
1:42:47
besides the first four digits yep 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
1:42:54
6 you could also use a negative index credit number if you need the last
1:43:01
character in a string you would set the index to be -1 then I will print
1:43:07
this print credit number at index of -1 that would be
1:43:14
six -2 is five -3 is
1:43:21
four -4 is three and then5 would be that dash right here yeah you can use
1:43:28
negative indexes too let's talk about step using the step field we can access
1:43:33
the characters in a string by a given step we can count by twos or we can
1:43:39
count by threes so here's an example so let's take our credit number if we're
1:43:44
not filling in these starting or ending fields but we need a step we would need two colons then Python is assuming
1:43:51
everything from the beginning of the string to the end then our step will be two this will print every second
1:43:59
character within our string yeah here we are we have 1 3 dash
1:44:05
6 8 9 1 so on and so
1:44:11
forth if I were to change the step to three we would count every third
1:44:16
character beginning with 1 4 6
1:44:23
dash 1 36 all right here's a practical example
1:44:28
let's create a program to get the last four digits of a credit card
1:44:33
number i'm going to assign this to a new variable
1:44:40
last digits equals our credit
1:44:46
number indexing operator so we need the last four digits where would the
1:44:51
starting index begin well we could use negative indexing this last digit is -1
1:44:57
-2 -3,4 we will begin at -4 colon we can omit the ending index
1:45:06
python assumes we need the rest of the string then really that's all we need so let's
1:45:12
print i'll use an fstring uh maybe some x's maybe we're
1:45:18
hiding somebody's credit card number except the last four digits okay then variable
1:45:26
last digits all right and here's our credit
1:45:31
card number where only the last four digits are visible hey you know what let's add one more exercise let's
1:45:39
reverse the characters in the string i'm going to reassign credit
1:45:44
number equals credit number if we need the entire string we
1:45:50
don't necessarily need a starting index or an ending index but for the step this
1:45:56
will be negative negative -1 will reverse a string then let's print whatever our new credit card number
1:46:03
is print credit number and yeah there is our credit
1:46:09
number backwards to reverse a string you set the step to be -1 so yeah everybody
1:46:16
that is string indexing in Python we can access elements of a sequence using the
1:46:21
indexing operator which is a set of straight brackets you can list a starting position ending position and
1:46:27
even a step if you need to skip over characters but yeah that is string indexing in
1:46:34
Python hey everybody in this topic I'm going to explain format specifiers
15.format specifiers
1:46:39
format specifiers when used in the context of an string they allow us to format a value based on what flags are
1:46:46
inserted following your value you would type a colon and then some flags
1:46:52
depending on what flags you insert it will format your output a certain way you could add decimal point precision
1:46:59
allocate space zero pad values left justify right justify center align all
1:47:06
sorts of things let's have some practice i'll create three prices price
1:47:12
one price two price three price one will be
1:47:20
3.14159 these values aren't in dollars and cents yet but they will
1:47:25
be price two will be 987.65 as you can see I'm just making up
1:47:32
numbers here price three is 12.34 let's display our prices using
1:47:39
some fstrings price one is placeholder price
1:47:47
1 then we will do this for price two and price three price two is price two price
1:47:54
three is price three within our placeholder following the value we can
1:48:00
add a colon then some flags those flags are the format specifiers they will
1:48:06
format our value a particular way depending on what we insert after the colon to add decimal point precision you
1:48:14
would type after the colon dot then the amount of decimals to be displayed maybe
1:48:20
two then f meaning floatingoint number let's do that with price two and price
1:48:26
three colon.2f price one is now 3.14 price 2
1:48:35
is987.65 price three is 12.34 i think I'm going to add some dollar signs before the
1:48:42
placeholder yeah that's much better for less precision maybe one decimal place
1:48:48
you can change the two to a one so.1
1:48:53
F each number only displays one decimal 0.1
1:48:59
6.3 whereas in 3F would display three decimal
1:49:05
places.142 650.340 even though price 2 and price 3
1:49:10
only have two decimal places in the original numbers we will concatenate some additional zeros to allocate space
1:49:17
to display a value after the colon add some number some number for that many spaces how about
1:49:29
10 each value now has a total of 10 spaces to display the output 1 2 3 4 5 6
1:49:37
7 8 9 10 if you were to preede a number with zero well these numbers would be zero
1:49:47
padded each number is now zero padded to left justify a value you would use a
1:49:53
left angle bracket all these numbers are now left
1:50:00
justified then we have all of the space after they're all uniform right justify
1:50:07
would be a right angle bracket and I believe that's the
1:50:14
default center align I believe is the carrot symbol
1:50:22
yep our numbers are now centered if you have any positive values
1:50:27
and you would like to display a plus sign just use
1:50:36
plus any positive number is preceded with a plus sign any negative number is preceded with the negative sign or you
1:50:43
could use a space for any positive numbers so colon space
1:50:49
These numbers are lined up evenly even though we have a negative number in here there is a thousand separator which is a
1:50:58
comma we should probably increase the value of our prices
1:51:03
3,00 9,870 1,200 each thousand's place is now
1:51:10
separated with a comma we could also mix and match flags i would like a thousand
1:51:16
separator along with decimal point precision of two decimal
1:51:23
places and why not i will preede each number with a plus sign if it's
1:51:31
positive yep here we are so based on what you're looking for you can add some
1:51:36
combination of flags so yeah those are format specifiers everybody within your
1:51:42
placeholder insert your value a colon then certain flags based on what you're
1:51:48
looking for exactly but yeah those are just a few format specifiers in
16.while loops ♾️
1:51:55
Python hey everybody in this topic I'm going to explain while loops a while loop will execute some code while some
1:52:02
condition remains true here's an example we'll use an if statement first we will ask a user for their name name equals
1:52:10
input enter your name if our name is equal to an empty
1:52:18
string that means the user didn't type in anything let's print a
1:52:23
message you did not enter your name
1:52:29
else we will print using an string
1:52:35
hello our user's name if I were to skip this
1:52:41
prompt we would execute this if statement then we continue with the rest of the program what if I would like to
1:52:47
continually prompt the user to type in their name we can't continue until they type in something well we could replace
1:52:54
this if statement with a while loop while this condition is true
1:53:00
continue to execute this code within the while loop i'm going to reprompt the user to type in a
1:53:07
name then if we were to exit the while loop then we will print hello whatever
1:53:13
your name is so let's run this enter your name i'm going to hit enter you did
1:53:19
not enter your name enter your name no no no okay I give up i'll type in my
1:53:24
first name hit enter hello whatever your first name is while this condition
1:53:29
remains true execute this code potentially forever until this condition
1:53:35
is no longer true so that's one of the main benefits of a while loop if it's not true then you exit out of the while
1:53:42
loop and that's why we're able to continue then print our name hello name you do want some way to escape out of
1:53:48
the while loop otherwise you'll run into what's known as an infinite loop so let's say while name is equal to an
1:53:55
empty string we will print you did not enter your name so I'm going to hit enter so we are
1:54:03
stuck in an infinite loop we can't actually escape this loop we didn't give ourselves an exit
1:54:09
strategy that's why previously we reprompted the user to type in something we're giving them a chance to escape in
1:54:15
a way it kind of works like an if statement but instead of executing some code once it's potentially infinite
1:54:21
here's another example this time let's ask for a user's age age equals and I
1:54:28
will convert the input to an integer enter your
1:54:34
age we'll need the user to type in a positive number while age is less than
1:54:44
zero let's print a message to let the user know that they can't do that
1:54:50
age can't be negative then we need some strategy to escape let's reprompt the
1:54:58
user to enter in their age once they type in something that's
1:55:03
valid we can escape out of the while loop so let's print using an fstring you
1:55:11
are age years old so enter your age i'm going to say
1:55:18
negative one age can't be negative -21 million okay I give up how about 21
1:55:27
you are 21 years old so that was another example while our age variable is less
1:55:33
than zero repeat this code forever let's go over example three i'm going to introduce some
1:55:39
logical operators we will have the user type in a food they like food equals
1:55:47
input enter a food you like but in order to escape they need to press Q to
1:55:55
quit while food is equal to the letter
1:56:01
Q continue this while loop however I'm going to make one change we want to exit
1:56:08
the while loop when they press Q so you could say while not food equals Q so
1:56:16
within this while loop let's print the food that they stated that they like i'll use an F string you like your
1:56:24
variable food then we will prompt the user to enter in another food that they like enter another food you like q to
1:56:33
quit then once we escape the while loop we will print just
1:56:38
buy okay okay enter a food you like q to quit i like pizza you like pizza i like
1:56:46
sushi you like sushi i like ramen you like ramen okay this program is kind of
1:56:52
lame so I'm going to press Q to quit and we escape the wild loop we have printed by so you could do something while
1:57:00
something is not true by using the not logical operator all right last example example four we will use the or logical
1:57:08
operator we'll ask a user to type in a number between 1 and 10 let's say num equals
1:57:17
input enter a number between 1 through
1:57:24
10 then I will type cast the input as an integer
1:57:32
while our number is less than one or our
1:57:38
number is greater than 10 let's reprompt the user let's print using an fstring
1:57:45
our variable num is not valid then we will reprompt
1:57:52
the user enter a number between 1 and 10 once we escape the while loop then we
1:58:00
will print our number using an fring your number is our variable
1:58:07
num enter a number between 1 through 10 0 zero is not valid negative
1:58:15
1 100 nope uh five your number is five
1:58:21
that's an example of how you can add logical operators to wild loops while this condition is true or this condition
1:58:28
is true execute this code forever all right everybody so those are while loops a while loop will execute some code
1:58:36
while some condition remains true it's fairly useful for verifying user input
1:58:42
if a user types in some input that is not valid you can reprompt them and there's many other uses that we'll
1:58:47
discuss in the future but yeah those are while loops in
1:58:52
Python why hello everybody in today's video we'll be creating a compound interest calculator in Python for those
17.compound interest calculator
1:58:59
that don't know interest is a charge for the privilege of borrowing money to some individual or organization when you
1:59:06
place money in a bank account you typically acrue interest we'll create a program to tell you what your new
1:59:11
balance will be after acrewing interest for so many years but the user is going to decide the initial principle that's
1:59:18
the investment the rate of interest and the time in years that this balance has been acrewing interest so let's begin
1:59:25
let's declare three variables a principle a rate that is rate of interest and time time will be in years
1:59:33
we've recently learned about while loops i would like to include those within this program just so we get the hang of
1:59:38
using them we will ask the user to type in an initial principal investment we will continue to prompt the user to type
1:59:45
in a principle that's above zero our condition will be while principal is
1:59:51
less than or equal to zero we will take our principal assign it some user
1:59:58
input enter the principal
2:00:04
amount then we would like to type cast our input as a floatingoint number
2:00:11
if our user input principle is less than or equal to zero we need to inform the
2:00:20
user principle can't be less than or equal to
2:00:29
zero so I'm going to test my program by printing the principal at the end just
2:00:36
temporarily enter the principal amount i can't type a negative number and continue what if my investment was
2:00:43
negative $1,000 principal can't be less than or equal to zero how about zero nope can't
2:00:50
do that either is a,000 okay yep a,000 works that is for the principal let's
2:00:56
copy this while loop paste it replace principal with rate this is the rate of
2:01:03
interest enter the interest rate
2:01:09
interest rate can't be less than or equal to zero then let's copy this again paste it
2:01:18
change rate to
2:01:24
time let's type cast our input as an integer because we're working with whole years enter the time in years
2:01:35
time can be less than or equal to zero i'm going to print my principal
2:01:42
rate and time we have
2:01:48
principal rate time okay we know that principle
2:01:55
works enter the interest rate can my interest rate be -1 no it can't can it
2:02:01
be zero nope how about 10 10% all right that works time can time be zero no it
2:02:09
can't can my time be negative 1 no it can't what about 3 years all right so we
2:02:15
know that our while loops are working now here's the formula to calculate interest
2:02:21
let's say our total that's our total balance equals our principal
2:02:29
times 1 + our rate divided by 100 i'm
2:02:34
going to enclose this function with the set of parenthesis this portion of our function will take our interest rate which is a
2:02:41
whole number then create a decimal enclose this function within the power function
2:02:48
raise this function to the power of time and that is how to calculate compound
2:02:54
interest then we will print the new balance I'll use an
2:03:00
fstring balance after our variable
2:03:05
time the word years I'll add a placeholder we will add
2:03:11
our total then I'll include a dollar sign maybe this will be in dollars but pick
2:03:17
any unit of currency you would like i will format this variable with the format specifier we will display two
2:03:23
decimal places 2F okay let's try this enter the principal amount i invest
2:03:31
$1,000 into maybe the stock market the interest rate is maybe 10%
2:03:37
this year the time in years will be 1 so after one year at 10% interest my new
2:03:45
balance is $1,100 let's try it one more time for good measure maybe $500 with an interest
2:03:52
rate of 7 over 2 years your new balance would be
2:03:57
$57245 all right now there is another way of writing this program what if we would like to allow the user to enter in
2:04:04
values that are equal to zero while principal is less than zero if principal
2:04:11
is less than zero principal can't be less than zero let's do that for
2:04:19
rate interest can't be less than
2:04:24
zero time can't be less than zero here's what
2:04:30
happens to our program remember that we're declaring our variables at the top uh nothing happens we go straight to
2:04:37
the results so the reason that this is happening is that when we reach the
2:04:42
while loops this condition is false from the beginning we never end up entering these while loops we skip over them
2:04:49
because these three conditions are all false we can write a different variation
2:04:54
of this while loop where we could say while true true is a boolean that means
2:05:01
this while loop will continue forever unless we explicitly break out of the while loop we're going to add an else
2:05:08
clause else we will break break will break out of a
2:05:14
loop with our second while loop change rate is less than zero to while true
2:05:20
then we will add an else clause else break out of the
2:05:25
loop while true
2:05:31
else break out of the loop we should be able to enter zero values in
2:05:37
now enter the principal amount 0 0 0 balance after 0 years is
2:05:45
$0 this should work the same as before but we should be allowed to enter in zero values
2:05:52
$1,000 interest rate of zero after one year is still
2:05:57
$1,000 well okay then everybody i thought that would be an interesting project to create now that we know how
2:06:03
while loops work you could write either a standard while loop with a condition such as principle is less than or equal
2:06:10
to zero or you could say while true this loop would continue forever you would
2:06:15
need to explicitly break out of the while loop using this break keyword which we'll cover again in four loops
2:06:22
but yeah that is a compound interest calculator in Python
18.for loops
2:06:28
hey everybody in this topic I need to explain for loops a for loop will execute a block of code a fixed number
2:06:36
of times you can iterate over a range a string a sequence anything that is
2:06:42
considered iterable i'll have more examples for you in future topics there is a lot of overlap where you could use
2:06:47
either a while loop or a for loop but for loops tend to be better in situations where you have to do
2:06:52
something only a fixed number of times here's an example suppose we need to count to 10 if we were to use a for loop
2:06:59
we could write something like this we would type four then we would need some sort of counter typically you see people
2:07:06
write x 4 x in then we will use the
2:07:11
range function what number would we like to start at i would like to start at 1
2:07:18
then count to 10 but the second number is exclusive so really we're going to
2:07:23
write 11 if we want to count to 10 so then colon then hit enter whatever
2:07:29
code you would like to repeat a certain number of times you will list underneath the for loop and make sure the code is
2:07:34
indented too i will print whatever our counter x is when I run this code we
2:07:40
will begin at 1 then stop once we reach 11 so yeah there we are we have begun at
2:07:47
one and we have counted all the way to 10 so that's the basic syntax for a for loop for some counter really you can
2:07:54
name this anything sometimes you'll see people name this as counter and that would work too but
2:08:00
let's stick with X in some range where would we like to begin where do we stop
2:08:08
okay now let's count backwards let's start at 10 then count down to zero when we escape the for loop let's
2:08:15
print happy new year when we print happy new year we are
2:08:22
outside of the for loop to count backwards you can enclose your range function within the reversed
2:08:28
function reversed so we begin at 10 count down to
2:08:36
one then print happy new year in this case to count backwards you would enclose the range function within the
2:08:43
reversed function there is an additional parameter too you could add that is the step if you would like to count by twos
2:08:50
you would add comma 2 so I'm going to get rid of happy new
2:08:55
year let's print the numbers 1 through 10 but we will count by
2:09:00
twos and this does begin at 1 though so 1 3 5 7 9 if you were to change the step
2:09:07
to three you would count by threes beginning at 1 4 7 10 so the range
2:09:14
function isn't the only thing you can iterate over you can iterate over a string let's say we have a credit card
2:09:19
number credit card equals I'll make up some credit card number with
2:09:28
dashes that is good enough for x in credit card print x will hold our
2:09:36
current position at first it'll be one then 2 3 4 dash so on and so forth so
2:09:42
here's our credit card number 1 2 3 4 dash 5 6 7 8 i think you get the idea so
2:09:49
you can iterate over a string with a for loop as well we'll have a few projects involving that there are two useful
2:09:56
keywords as well these aren't exclusive to for loops you can use these within while loops as well they are continue
2:10:02
and break suppose we going to count to 20 for x in range we will begin at one
2:10:10
stop at 21 i think this is kind of a dumb example but it gets the point across 13 is considered an unlucky
2:10:17
number right what if our counter reaches 13 i would like to skip over it well we can do that with the continue
2:10:24
keyword if x is equal to 13 we will continue and skip over that
2:10:31
iteration else we will print whatever our counter is so let's take a look
2:10:39
yeah we have the numbers 1 through 20 but we have skipped the number 13 to
2:10:45
skip over an iteration you can use the continue keyword whereas the break keyword we will break out of this loop
2:10:52
entirely if x is equal to 13 then
2:10:57
break so yeah we have only counted to 12 once we reach 13 we have escaped the
2:11:03
loop so yeah everybody those are four loops you can execute a block of code a
2:11:09
fixed number of times you can iterate over a range a string a sequence
2:11:14
anything that is considered iterable there is a lot of overlap where you could use either a while loop or a for
2:11:20
loop while loops tend to be better if you need to execute something possibly infinite amount of times such as when
2:11:26
you're accepting user input for example but yeah everybody those are for loops in
19.countdown timer program
2:11:33
Python what is going on everybody in today's topic we're going to be creating a countdown timer in Python we'll be
2:11:40
using what we learned in the previous topics let's begin we'll need to import the time module there's a pretty cool
2:11:47
function within the time module that is the sleep function type time do sleep
2:11:53
add a set of parenthesis within the set of parenthesis our program will
2:11:59
essentially sleep for a given amount of seconds like three after three seconds
2:12:04
let's print something this is just a demonstration times
2:12:12
up when I execute this code nothing happens for 3 seconds but after 3
2:12:17
seconds passes it displays our message times up so you can use the sleep function of the time module to sleep for
2:12:24
a given amount of time we will ask the user how long would they like to set the timer for we will create a variable
2:12:32
let's say my time my time will be in seconds we will create a prompt enter
2:12:41
the time in seconds then we should type cast our
2:12:46
input as an integer we'll need to create a loop we
2:12:53
could use either a while loop or a for loop there's a lot of overlap where you could use either one i'll use a for loop
2:12:59
in this case four we'll need some sort of counter X in our
2:13:06
range zero through my
2:13:12
time after each iteration we will sleep for 1 second let's test what we have so
2:13:19
far i would like to sleep for 3
2:13:24
seconds i think that's approximately three but now we are going to print whatever x is print x x is our
2:13:35
counter 0 1 2 times up we're getting
2:13:41
somewhere but I would like to count backwards what we could do is enclose
2:13:46
our range function within the reversed function but another technique that we
2:13:53
can use is by using a step let's replace zero with my
2:13:59
time then end at zero but we will set the step to be - 1 then we can increment
2:14:07
backwards using this function that's another technique too to count backwards so let's wait for 3 seconds 3 2 1 times
2:14:17
up now let's display a digital clock of some sort but we would have to calculate
2:14:23
how many hours minutes and seconds there are so let's calculate seconds seconds
2:14:29
equals x x is our counter remember modulus
2:14:35
60 within our print statement we'll use an f string we are displaying hours
2:14:40
minutes and seconds i'll add some placeholders for each of these fields we
2:14:46
have seconds with our digital clock we can't go above 60 for either seconds or
2:14:52
minutes that's why I'm using modulus 60 the modulus operator gives you the remainder of any division let's begin at
2:14:59
11 so 11 10 9 so it is counting down but
2:15:05
I would like to add some zero padding and we can do that with the format specifier after seconds I will add colon
2:15:13
i need to display two digits then zero pad those digits let's try that again i
2:15:20
will wait for 11 seconds 11 10 9 yeah and we do have some zero padding so
2:15:26
that's looking more and more like a digital clock let's add minutes then so to calculate minutes let's assign
2:15:34
variable minutes equal to x / 60 because
2:15:40
there's 60 seconds within a minute but then I'm going to type cast the result as an
2:15:48
integer modulus 60 we would not like this field of minutes to go above 60 so
2:15:55
let's add a placeholder we're displaying minutes format specifier
2:16:02
02 now I'm going to wait for 65 seconds that is 1 minute and 5
2:16:08
seconds then I just want to be sure that we go below a minute
2:16:13
yep it's working then let's calculate hours oh by the way to stop your program from running hit this red square up in
2:16:20
the corner let's calculate hours hours equals x /
2:16:28
3,600 there's 3,600 seconds in an hour then we will type cast the result
2:16:35
as an integer within our fing we will
2:16:42
display ours format specifier 02 then I will run this program let's
2:16:50
wait for 3,65 seconds that is 1 hour and 5
2:16:56
seconds and I just want to be sure that we go below 1 hour yeah all right so
2:17:02
that works so the reason that I didn't add modulus 24 I don't have days within my fing we
2:17:10
can display any amount of hours i will exclude modulus 24 all right everybody well I thought
2:17:17
that'd be some good practice with working with loops we should try and do as many exercises as we can and yeah
2:17:23
that is a countdown timer program in Python hey everybody so I guess in
20.nested loops
2:17:30
today's topic I'm going to be explaining nested loops it looks like so a nested loop think of it as a loop found within
2:17:37
the code of another loop you have a loop right any code within that loop is indented underneath that loop well you
2:17:44
could have a looping structure found within the code of another looping structure the loop on the outside is the
2:17:50
outer loop the internal loop within the outer loop is known as the inner loop where you'll encounter nested loops it's
2:17:57
really situational you could have a while loop inside of a while loop a for loop inside of a for loop a for loop
2:18:03
inside of a while loop a while loop inside of a for loop etc so here's a demonstration let's begin by displaying
2:18:09
the numbers 1 through 9 but we'll use a loop for x x is our counter in
2:18:16
range 1 10 remember that the second number in this case 10 that's exclusive
2:18:24
then I will print our counter X this program will print the numbers one
2:18:31
through nine now we have an exercise at the end of this topic i should probably explain this feature so with a print
2:18:38
statement we end each print statement with a new line character if I need all of these numbers on the same line at the
2:18:45
end of my print statement I can add comma end equals an empty string
2:18:52
normally with a print statement each ends with a new line character but we can set that to be something
2:18:58
else so when I run this again all of these numbers are on the same line or
2:19:03
you could add a different symbol like dash or a space each of these characters is now
2:19:09
separated with a space but let's stick with an empty string okay so we have used a loop to
2:19:16
count the numbers 1 through nine what if I would like to repeat this three times
2:19:22
well I could create another loop for x in range you could say 1 4 or
2:19:30
you could just say three either way whatever code is within this loop will be executed three times let's cut
2:19:38
our original for loop then place it within the code of our new loop our
2:19:44
outer loop will have this code repeat entirely three separate times uh but we
2:19:50
do have one thing we need to pay attention to we have two counters with the same name you'll want to be sure
2:19:56
that they're different let's rename the counter of the inner loop to be y instead of x and be sure to change that
2:20:03
here as well now when I run this code we're completing let's see 27 iterations to
2:20:11
exit this for loop we need to count the numbers 1 through nine once we do so
2:20:16
that is one iteration of the outer loop but our outer loop is saying "Hey we still need three total iterations." Now
2:20:23
if you would like these on separate lines let's make this look a little different let's add each iteration of
2:20:29
the outer loop onto a new line so within the outer loop but not
2:20:34
within the inner loop I'm going to create just a blank print statement this will just print a new line let's try
2:20:41
this again with the inner loop we count the numbers 1 through nine after we exit the
2:20:47
for loop we will print a new line then repeat this all over again until our
2:20:53
outer loop is satisfied so that's basically a nested loop it's just a loop that's inside of another looping
2:20:59
structure so let's create a project we're going to print a rectangle made of some symbol that we set we'll have the
2:21:05
user type in how many rows and columns this rectangle will have we'll reuse this code that we have already written
2:21:12
so this time let's accept some user input rows equals
2:21:18
input enter the number of rows then we
2:21:23
should type cast this input as an integer let's copy this line paste it
2:21:30
change rows to columns for the second line enter the number of
2:21:37
columns then let's create a symbol symbol equals
2:21:43
input enter a symbol to use we already have this rectangle
2:21:50
structure right think of it as the outer loop is in charge of the rows let's
2:21:55
change in range three to in range rows the inner loop will be in charge of the
2:22:02
columns for y in range columns we will print our symbol
2:22:10
whatever the user chooses so let's try this again enter the number of rows how
2:22:16
about four rows 10 columns i'll use a dollar sign
2:22:22
so here's our rectangle we have four rows then 10 columns 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
2:22:33
10 let's try it one more time three rows five columns and I'll use an
2:22:41
asterisk yep three rows five columns so yeah that's a nested loop
2:22:48
really it's just a loop that's inside of another loop the type of loop really doesn't matter as well as what's within
2:22:54
each loop it's just a situation where you have a loop inside of another loop and yeah those are nested loops in
2:23:02
Python well hello everybody today I will be explaining a few different types of collections in Python there's four
21.lists, sets, and tuples
2:23:09
general purpose collections three of them are lists sets and tpples there are
2:23:15
also dictionaries but I'll save that for the next topic because they can be kind of tricky a collection I would think of
2:23:20
them as a single variable and I'm saying that within quotes that is used to store
2:23:26
multiple values that's how I would explain a collection to a beginner for example let's say we have a variable
2:23:32
variable fruit fruit equals some value like apple and then I can print this
2:23:39
fruit which is apple i could turn this variable into a collection by
2:23:45
surrounding my values with either a set of square brackets for a list curly braces for a set or parenthesis for a
2:23:52
tuple let's begin with a list if I would like to store more than one value in this variable I will surround my values
2:23:59
with a set of square brackets this variable is now a list i can store multiple values separated with a comma
2:24:07
not only do we have an apple in this variable but we have an orange a
2:24:13
banana and coconut one naming convention that I like to use if I declare a collection
2:24:20
such as a list set or tpple I like to take the variable name and make it plural just so that it's more obvious
2:24:26
that this is a collection of values technically in the English language fruit would still be plural english is a
2:24:33
weird language we now have a list of fruit named fruits if I were to print my
2:24:40
list this is the result we have all of our values enclosed with a set of square
2:24:46
brackets to access one of these elements found within your list you can use the
2:24:51
index operator much like what we can do with strings the first element would have an index of zero that would print
2:24:58
my value apple index of one would be my orange
2:25:03
two is banana three coconut what about four we don't have a value
2:25:11
there list index out of range each value in a collection is also known as an
2:25:17
element if we attempt to access an element that's not found within our collection you'll run into an index
2:25:23
error with the index operator you could set a beginning index an ending index
2:25:29
and a step i would like the first three elements you could say zero colon
2:25:36
three that would give me apple orange banana technically you don't even need the zero you need that colon though we
2:25:43
can even use a step i would like every second element apple banana it's every second
2:25:49
element beginning from index zero maybe I would like my fruit backwards i'll set the step to be negative 1 coconut banana
2:25:57
orange apple you can use the index operator with collections much like you can use with strings another cool thing
2:26:03
you can do too with collections is that you can iterate over them with the for loop for x in my collection
2:26:12
fruits what would we like to do i will print whatever x is so we have iterated over our list
2:26:21
apple orange banana coconut now x isn't really too descriptive what you'll see some people do is that with their
2:26:27
collection name it's plural their counter will be the singular version of that word if our collection name is
2:26:33
fruits let's rename x as fruit singular it's not mandatory but that's a
2:26:41
common convention it's more readable that way for every fruit in fruits if
2:26:46
this were cars you could say for car in cars our counter is storing whatever
2:26:52
value is within our collection so what are all the different methods that we can use with collections to list the
2:26:58
different methods that are available to a collection you can use the dur function within this function add your
2:27:06
collection fruits but we would need to print this let's surround this function with a
2:27:12
print statement these are all in alphabetical order we have attributes which I have
2:27:18
not explained yet but I will in a future topic but if we scroll to the end we
2:27:24
have a bunch of different methods that this list can perform append clear copy count extend index insert pop remove
2:27:31
reverse and sort if you would like a description of each of these methods there is a help function help add your
2:27:38
collection to the parenthesis then we would need to print
2:27:46
this here's the description of all the methods and attributes for example we have our sort method and here's a
2:27:53
description sort the list in ascending order and return none and then a bunch of other stuff if you ever forget what
2:28:00
you're capable of with a list or other collection you can always use the help function to print a description of the
2:28:06
attributes and methods available if you need the length of how many elements are within a collection there is the length
2:28:14
function return the length of my list fruits then let's print it there's four
2:28:21
elements within my list the length function returns four if I were to add
2:28:26
an extra element like a pineapple then that number would be
2:28:32
five let's remove that using the in operator we can find if a value is
2:28:38
within a collection is our value apple in fruits
2:28:46
but then we would need to print this this operator will return a boolean so let's print whatever that
2:28:52
is is apple in fruits that is true but
2:28:57
is pineapple pineapple is not it's false
2:29:02
you can use the in operator to find if a value is within a list and that applies for your other collections
2:29:08
too with lists they're ordered and changeable duplicates are okay we can
2:29:14
change one of these values after we create our list let's take fruits at
2:29:19
index of zero i will set this equal to be a pineapple then let's iterate over our
2:29:29
fruit using a for loop okay the first element is no longer
2:29:34
an apple it's a pineapple then orange banana coconut using an index you can reassign one of the values if I were to
2:29:41
change zero to one well now we have an apple pineapple banana
2:29:47
coconut let's cover some of the methods that are found within a list we can append an element type the name of the
2:29:55
list dot append what would we like to append to the end of this list let's
2:30:00
append a pineapple i'm going to get rid of this for loop i'm just going to display my
2:30:06
list there we have an apple an orange banana coconut pineapple to add an element to the end of a list use the
2:30:13
append method to remove an element you can use the remove method
2:30:19
fruits let's remove our apple our apple is no longer there we
2:30:25
have an orange banana coconut using the insert method we can insert a value at a
2:30:30
given index fruits do.insert list an index zero would be
2:30:37
the beginning then a value
2:30:42
pineapple now we have a pineapple apple orange banana coconut the sort method
2:30:48
will sort a list fruits do.sort these are all in alphabetical
2:30:54
order now apple banana coconut orange to reverse a list you would use
2:31:00
the reverse method fruits.reverse coconut banana orange
2:31:07
apple however these are not in reverse alphabetical order these elements are reversed based on the order in which we
2:31:13
place them if you would like reverse alphabetical order you can first sort
2:31:18
and then reverse now we have orange coconut banana apple to clear a list use the clear
2:31:26
method fruits all of the elements are
2:31:32
gone we can return the index of a value let's return the index of
2:31:38
apple fruits do index list an
2:31:44
element then we will need to print this let's print the index that is
2:31:52
returned the index of apple is zero
2:31:57
coconut that would be three what if we don't find a value like a pineapple
2:32:05
well we have an error pineapple is not in list you could count the amount of times that a value is found within a
2:32:12
list because duplicates are okay fruits doc count let's count how many bananas
2:32:18
are in this list banana then print
2:32:26
it one banana is found within this list how about pineapples
2:32:33
there are zero now those are lists surround your values with a set of square brackets these values are ordered
2:32:40
and changeable duplicates are okay now let's talk about the next collection which is a set to create a set surround
2:32:48
your values instead with a set of curly braces our collection of fruits is now a
2:32:53
set a set has different benefits the values are unordered and immutable
2:32:59
meaning we can't alter these values however we can add and remove elements a
2:33:04
set does not include any duplicates i'm going to delete these methods then print
2:33:10
fruits we have all of the same values but they're not in the same order as they were originally a set is unordered
2:33:18
if I were to run this again they will likely be in a different order see now we have a banana apple coconut orange to
2:33:25
display all of the different attributes and methods of a set you can use the dur
2:33:33
function and here's all of them some of these methods are a little more advanced but there's a few we might recognize
2:33:39
like add clear copy for an in-depth description of these methods you can use the help
2:33:46
function much like what we did before to find the length of our set we can use the length function which is
2:33:54
four we can use the in operator to find if a value is found within this set
2:34:00
unfortunately pineapples are not within our set now if I was to use the index
2:34:05
operator of my set this is what would happen we have an error set object is
2:34:13
not subscriptable we're not able to use indexing on a set because they're unordered much like what we can do with
2:34:19
a list or a string we can't change the values of a set but we could add or
2:34:24
remove elements let's use the add method to add guess what a
2:34:32
pineapple that is okay orange apple pineapple coconut
2:34:37
banana we can remove an element fruits let's remove our
2:34:44
apple our apple is gone coconut orange banana we can
2:34:53
pop the pop method will remove whatever element is first but it's going to be random
2:34:59
though orange coconut banana apple coconut banana apple banana
2:35:07
coconut you can clear fruit the elements of our set are gone those
2:35:14
are a few of the more useful methods for beginners as a summary a set is a collection that is unordered and
2:35:21
immutable you can't change the values but adding and removing elements is okay no duplicates are allowed let's try that
2:35:28
real quick i'm going to add a second coconut yeah see we only still have one
2:35:35
coconut sets may work well if you're working with constants maybe colors for
2:35:40
example you need to find if a color is within a set all right now lastly let's talk about tpples a tpple is a
2:35:47
collection that is surrounded with a set of parenthesis tpples are ordered and
2:35:52
unchangeable duplicates are okay one benefit of a tpple over a list is that
2:35:58
tpples are faster than lists if you're working with a collection and it's okay if the collection is ordered and
2:36:03
unchangeable you might as well use a tpple because it's faster when I print our tpple all of these values are
2:36:09
surrounded with a set of parenthesis again we have the dur function to display the attributes and methods
2:36:16
there's not as many for a tpple for methods we only have count and index again there's also
2:36:22
help to display a description of these attributes and methods you can find the
2:36:28
length of a tpple with the length function we have five elements within here using the in operator we can find
2:36:34
if a value is found within our tpple our pineapple is not within our
2:36:40
fruits so there's only two methods we have access to let's find the index of apple
2:36:47
fruits.index apple then I will print whatever is
2:36:53
returned apple is found at index zero there is also count
2:36:59
fruits.ount how many coconuts are found within our tpple fruits count the coconuts then print
2:37:09
this how many coconuts we have two coconuts and then again with any of
2:37:15
these collections they're iterable so you can iterate over them using a for loop four fruit and
2:37:22
fruits yep apple orange banana coconut coconut all right everybody so those are
2:37:28
collections think of them as a single variable used to store multiple values
2:37:33
there's four general purpose collections for beginners lists sets tpples and then
2:37:39
dictionaries which we'll talk about next each of them has unique benefits lists are ordered and changeable duplicates
2:37:46
are okay a set is unordered and immutable but adding and removing
2:37:51
elements is okay no duplicates allowed a tpple is ordered and unchangeable
2:37:57
duplicates are okay and they are faster than lists use tpples if you can over a
2:38:02
list but yeah those are a few collections in Python hello everybody today we will be
22.shopping cart program
2:38:10
creating a shopping cart program this program will be an exercise to follow the previous lesson on lists sets and
2:38:17
tpples the more that we practice with those collections the better we'll be at using them so I thought we'd create an
2:38:23
exercise to get the hang of it before moving on in this program we will have two lists foods these lists will be
2:38:30
empty we'll declare them but not use them quite yet and prices then a total total equals zero
2:38:40
the reason that I'm not using tpples is that tpples are unchangeable we're going to ask a user what food they would like
2:38:47
to buy we can't append any elements to a tpple we're not using sets because sets
2:38:52
are unordered i mean I guess technically you could but at the end of this program I'm going to print our shopping cart in
2:38:58
order so I think lists would probably be the best we have an empty list of foods and an empty list of prices we'll use a
2:39:06
while loop while true if our condition is set to true
2:39:12
we'll need some way to break out of the while loop we'll need a break statement somewhere we'll get to that later we will ask the
2:39:19
user what food would they like to buy let's declare variable food equal to
2:39:26
input enter a food to
2:39:31
buy to exit the while loop you need to press Q to quit
2:39:40
then let's check if food is equal to Q
2:39:46
lowercase Q then we will break we're not done with the program but let's at least
2:39:51
test it pizza
2:39:57
hamburger hot dog Q to quit okay it looks like it works now what if somebody
2:40:03
types in uppercase Q pizza hamburger uppercase Q well we
2:40:11
can't actually quit after accepting our user input if food lower method this
2:40:19
will take our input make it lowercase just for a comparison let's try that
2:40:26
again pizza hamburger i'll type capital Q to quit and that is
2:40:33
valid follow food with the lower method to temporarily make the user input
2:40:38
lowercase just in case they type in capital Q if the user doesn't want to
2:40:44
quit let's add an else statement else let's take our foods use
2:40:50
the append method then add whatever food the user typed in we'll also need a
2:40:56
price let's ask a user for the price price
2:41:01
equals input enter the price of let's use an F
2:41:10
string a whatever food the user types in pick a unit of currency I'll pick
2:41:18
dollars we are working with numbers we should type cast our input as a floatingoint
2:41:24
number since we're working with prices so we will accept a price add our
2:41:30
food item to our list of foods do the same thing with prices
2:41:36
prices.append whatever the price was and that is the while loop let's
2:41:42
test this program again to be sure that everything's working pizza pizza will be
2:41:50
$5.99 enter a food to buy hamburger hamburgers will be
2:41:55
350 hot dog hot dogs will be 175 i would like to quit i will type either capital
2:42:02
Q or lowercase Q both will work and we have escaped the while loop so the while
2:42:08
loop is now complete outside of the while loop let's display our shopping cart let's print some decorative
2:42:15
text maybe five dashes your cart then another five dashes
2:42:22
i will then iterate over all of the elements found within my foods list for every food in my list of
2:42:33
foods let's print each food item let's take a look so far again we have a pizza
2:42:40
the price was $5.99 hamburger the price was
2:42:46
350 hot dog 175 q to quit okay your
2:42:53
cart that will display the individual list items if you would rather have these list items arranged horizontally
2:43:00
in one line you can add this keyword end equals
2:43:05
this end keyword will replace the new line character at the end of a print statement with some other character like
2:43:11
a space let's try that again i'll try not to take too much time
2:43:18
pizza 5.99
2:43:23
hamburger 350 hot dog
2:43:30
175 q to quit yeah that's much better we are horizontally listing all of the
2:43:36
different items within our list you could revert back to the vertical list if you'd prefer that i'll keep my output
2:43:42
like this then we will need to iterate and add up all the prices for every
2:43:47
price in prices we do have a total variable that we declared let's utilize that total
2:43:55
equals total plus price otherwise we could shorten this to plus equals price
2:44:02
that would do the same thing then we will display the total print i'll use an fstring
2:44:11
your total is I'll add a unit of currency i picked
2:44:17
the dollar sign whatever the total is okay let's run this program one last
2:44:24
time enter a food to buy pizza which was
2:44:29
$5.99 hamburger which was 350 hot
2:44:35
dogs they are 175 q to quit here's your shopping cart i'm just
2:44:42
going to add one new line real quick right before we display the total just an empty print
2:44:57
statement here are the results your cart pizza hamburger hot dog your total is
2:45:05
$11.24 all right everybody well that is a shopping cart program i thought this would be a fun exercise to follow the
2:45:11
previous lesson on lists sets and tpples and well yeah that is a shopping cart
2:45:17
program in Python hey what's going on everybody so
23.2D collections
2:45:23
today I'm going to be explaining 2D lists 2d meaning two-dimensional you do
2:45:28
also have the capability of creating 2D tpples i thought today we would use 2D lists just because they're pretty
2:45:34
flexible a two-dimensional list is just a list made up of lists it's really
2:45:40
useful if you ever need a grid or matrix of data kind of like an Excel spreadsheet let's create three lists a
2:45:47
list of fruit vegetables and
2:45:53
meat i'm going to speed up this video feel free to pause if you need to catch
2:46:00
up
2:46:11
here I have three lists a list of fruit vegetables and meat each of these lists
2:46:17
is a one-dimensional list to create a two-dimensional list well you would begin by creating a one-dimensional list
2:46:24
let's create a list of groceries all I would need to do is add my
2:46:29
individual lists as elements to the outer list the 2D list we have fruits
2:46:35
vegetables and meats normally to print a list or your
2:46:41
other collections you would print the name of the list in my list fruits I have apple
2:46:48
orange banana coconut to access or change one of the elements you would type the name of the list then use the
2:46:54
index operator so fruits at index of zero is a pineapple
2:47:00
again with a 2D list it's a little different if I were to print my 2D list
2:47:05
of groceries we would lay out the entire 2D list flat we have individual lists
2:47:13
separated with a comma all enclosed within a set of square brackets taking the elements found within our 2D list
2:47:20
I'm going to line these up kind of like this it kind of represents a grid or matrix with rows and columns each
2:47:27
individual list resembles a row each element resembles a column if I were to
2:47:32
print groceries at index zero in place of returning one element found within
2:47:38
one of the lists that would return an entire row so groceries at index zero is
2:47:44
my fruits list groceries at index one is my vegetables list groceries at index 2
2:47:51
is my meats list for one of the elements found within one of the rows you would need two
2:47:58
indices if I need the apple from the first row within my 2D list of groceries
2:48:03
that would be row 0 column 0 it's kind of like coordinates row 0 column 0 that
2:48:11
would be my apple 01 which is an orange
2:48:18
02 is banana 03 is coconut for the next row I would set the first index to be
2:48:26
one row one column zero that would be celery i'm going to speedrun this real
2:48:32
quick just to show you all the different elements 1 one is carrots one two is
2:48:38
potatoes if we try to access 13 that index is out of range because we
2:48:44
only have three elements within this row so then the next row would have an index
2:48:49
of two column 0 would be chicken 2 1 is
2:48:56
fish 2 is turkey 2 3 is out of bounds to access an
2:49:02
element from a 2D list you would need two indices in place of one because using just one would return the entire
2:49:09
row like so now when you declare a 2D list you don't need to necessarily give
2:49:15
each inner list a name we could do something like this i'm going to replace these names
2:49:23
with the rows i'm just going to put these on a
2:49:29
new line to make it more
2:49:35
readable there that would work too just separate each inner list with a comma
2:49:41
then enclose everything with a set of square brackets if you ever need to iterate over the elements of a 2D list
2:49:47
you can use nested loops if I were to use a single for loop let's say for
2:49:52
every uh maybe collection for every collection
2:49:58
in groceries let's print what our collection
2:50:06
is using a single for loop would iterate over the rows but to also iterate over
2:50:12
the elements found within each row we would use a nested loop
2:50:17
for every food in our collection let's print what our food
2:50:27
is using nested loops we can iterate over all of the elements found within our 2D list but I'm going to make this
2:50:33
more organized like that grid structure we have i'm going to replace the new line character at the end of a print
2:50:39
statement with a space then when we exit the nested loop I will
2:50:44
print a new line by using just an empty print statement there that kind of resembles
2:50:50
our grid structure we have rows and we have columns with
2:50:56
two-dimensional collections you're not limited to just lists you could create a list of
2:51:01
tpples so the inner rows will be surrounded with a set of
2:51:07
parenthesis you know this is also valid too or you could make a 2D tpple it's a
2:51:14
tpple that's made up of tpples you could make a tpple made up of sets sets are enclosed with a set of
2:51:21
curly braces here we have a tpple made of sets
2:51:29
use whatever is best for your own programs let's go over an exercise let's create a two-dimensional keypad that you
2:51:36
would normally find on a phone we have three data types a list a set or a tpple
2:51:43
the elements in a set are unordered so we can't use that these numbers need to be in order if we have the option a
2:51:50
tpple is faster than a list a tpple is ordered and unchangeable so we should
2:51:55
use it if we can and that's perfectly fine let's create a 2D tpple this time i
2:52:01
will name this 2D tpple numpad we have an outer set of parenthesis then an inner set of
2:52:07
parenthesis for each row we will have four rows the first row will be 1 2 3 the
2:52:17
second row I'm going to put this on a new line 4 5
2:52:23
6 the next row will be 7 8 9 then the last row will be an asterisk character
2:52:32
then zero then the pound sign so numpad in
2:52:37
this case is a 2D tpple let's use a for loop to iterate over every row this will
2:52:44
be the outer loop for every maybe row for every row in
2:52:50
numpad let's begin by printing our
2:52:55
row so we're printing every row in our numpad but I'd like to remove the parenthesis
2:53:02
let's create a nested loop for every maybe num for num in
2:53:12
row print whatever that num is we have one long vertical line let's
2:53:20
replace the new line character at the end of our print statement with a
2:53:26
space then when we escape the nested loop let's print a new line
2:53:33
and there is our telephone number pad you can see it's a grid made up of rows and columns so yeah that's a 2D list
2:53:40
well a 2D collection it's a collection that's made up of collections then with
2:53:46
our numpad we made a 2D tuple if you ever need a grid or matrix of data a 2D
2:53:51
collection would work perfect and there you have it everybody those are 2D collections in Python
24.quiz game
2:54:00
hello again everybody so today we're going to create a quiz game in Python let's declare all of the different
2:54:06
collections and variables that we'll need first we will need a tuple of
2:54:11
questions a 2D tuple of options my quiz will have five questions
2:54:18
but you can add more or less
2:54:23
questions then a tuple of answers
2:54:28
a list of guesses we will be appending guesses to our list that's why we're
2:54:34
using a list rather than a tpple a score variable which I will set to be zero then question
2:54:42
number this variable will keep track of what number question we're on all right let's begin with our questions i have
2:54:52
five
2:55:14
here are my questions they're all science related feel free to choose your own this is what I have how many
2:55:21
elements are in the periodic table which animal lays the largest eggs what is the
2:55:26
most abundant gas in Earth's atmosphere how many bones are in the human body which planet in the solar system is the
2:55:33
hottest these are the questions but we'll need options let's add four
2:55:38
options for every question that's why we're using a two-dimensional tpple each inner tpple will consist of four
2:55:46
elements
2:55:54
they will be options A B C or
2:56:01
D let's copy these elements then paste them within each
2:56:08
tpple this first element corresponds to my first question how many elements are
2:56:13
in the periodic table i'll come up with some answers
2:56:20
i'll add some answers for the rest of these tpples too
2:56:50
we have a tuple of correct answers the orders are C
2:56:57
D A A B if you come up with your own options
2:57:06
your answers may be different now that we have all of our different collections and variables taken care of let's
2:57:12
display each question i will iterate over our tpple of questions they are
2:57:17
iterable for every question in questions I'm going to print some
2:57:24
decorative text i think that's probably
2:57:29
good then I will print each question we're iterating over so let's see what
2:57:36
we have so far there's all five questions after we display every
2:57:43
question I need to display every option for every option in
2:57:50
options our options options is a 2D tuple let's add the index operator the
2:57:59
index is going to be our question number variable it's a number so at first we're
2:58:05
accessing options at index of zero then 1 2 3 4
2:58:11
5 we will print every option in options
2:58:16
add a given row number let's test this okay we have some options but all of
2:58:23
these options are for the first question we will need to increment our question number so let's do that maybe here
2:58:34
question number plus equals
2:58:40
1 that is much better before iterating the question number we will ask the user
2:58:46
for a guess guess equals
2:58:53
input enter A B C D
2:59:03
in case the user types in something that's lowercase I will follow this input with the upper method to make the
2:59:09
user input uppercase we will take our list of
2:59:15
guesses use the append method add our guess to that
2:59:21
list if our guess is equal to the
2:59:26
answers tpple at index of question number that means the user guessed the
2:59:33
right answer let's increase the user score sc score score plus equals 1 then
2:59:38
print the word correct correct else we will
2:59:47
print incorrect i'll use an
2:59:55
fstring our answers at index of question
3:00:02
number is the correct answer all right let's answer
3:00:08
some of these questions c correct which animal lays
3:00:16
the largest eggs um definitely the whale because the whale is the largest creature
3:00:22
right incorrect d is the correct answer what is the most abundant gas in Earth's atmosphere nitrogen correct how many
3:00:30
bones are in the human body d that is incorrect a is the right answer which
3:00:36
planet in the solar system is the hottest mercury because it's closest to the sun right wrong incorrect b is the correct
3:00:44
answer we're keeping track of our answers successfully once we complete all the questions let's print the
3:00:51
results i'm going to add some decorative text not necessary but I think it would
3:00:56
look cool i will display the
3:01:05
results we will iterate over all of the answers and the
3:01:11
guesses print
3:01:17
answers i'm going to set the ending character to be an empty
3:01:23
string for every answer in
3:01:30
answers print each answer i will set the ending character
3:01:37
to be a space to separate each answer then I'll add a new print
3:01:43
line let's do this with guesses change answers to guesses for
3:01:50
every guess in guesses print each guess
3:01:57
okay I'm going to run this again i'm just going to make up some answers a B C D A here are the correct
3:02:06
answers here are the guesses i guess none of them right then we will print a
3:02:12
score score equals take our score
3:02:17
divided by I'm going to use the length function then pass in our questions how
3:02:24
many elements are within our questions tuple then I will multiply all of this
3:02:29
by 100 to give us a percentage then type cast this whole formula as an integer
3:02:36
so we're basically just reassigning our score variable then let's print using an
3:02:43
fring your score is our score variable then add percent
3:02:52
i'm going to intentionally get all the answers right c D
3:02:59
A B here are the answers here are your guesses your score is 100% this time
3:03:06
I'll try and get a few incorrect intentionally c
3:03:12
C your score is 20% all right everybody well that is a quiz game feel free to add more or less
3:03:19
questions or come up with your own questions and that is a quiz game written in
25.dictionaries
3:03:27
Python hey everybody in today's video I'm going to explain dictionaries a dictionary is one of the four basic
3:03:33
collection types for beginners a dictionary consists of key value pairs they are ordered and changeable no
3:03:40
duplicates allowed a few examples of key value pairs could be an ID and a name an
3:03:46
item and a price but in today's example we'll create a dictionary of countries
3:03:51
and capitals let's name our dictionary capitals capitals equals enclose your
3:03:58
dictionary with a set of curly braces much like what you do with sets the first country will be the USA to add a
3:04:06
value to this key type colon then some other value the capital of the USA will
3:04:12
be Washington DC separate each key value pair with a
3:04:19
comma then we can add another key value pair so the capital of
3:04:25
India that will be New Delhi we'll add
3:04:30
two more china the capital is
3:04:36
Beijing russia the capital is Moscow i think
3:04:43
that's good enough just as a reminder if you would like to see all of the different attributes and methods of a dictionary
3:04:50
you can use the dur function pass in your dictionary capitals then we'll need
3:04:55
to print this here's all the different attributes and
3:05:01
methods of a dictionary if you would like an in-depth description of all these attributes and methods you can use
3:05:07
the help function uh that's herp help there we
3:05:17
go so yeah that's just a reminder all right let's go over a few of the methods to get one of the values
3:05:25
from a dictionary you would get the key type the name of the dictionary
3:05:31
capitals.get let's get the capital of the USA then we'll print
3:05:39
it the value associated with this key the USA is Washington DC if I picked a
3:05:46
different country like India well then we would get that associated value which is New Delhi
3:05:54
another thing if Python doesn't find a key this is what will be returned let's get Japan which is not in our
3:06:01
dictionary this method would return none we can use this within an if
3:06:08
statement if capitals get
3:06:14
Japan if a value is returned then we will
3:06:19
print that capital exists
3:06:25
else we will print that capital doesn't
3:06:33
exist so Japan is not in our dictionary that capital doesn't exist but Russia
3:06:39
is that capital does exist that's how to check to see if a key is within our
3:06:45
dictionary you can use the get method all right moving on let's update
3:06:50
our dictionary capitals.update so within a set of curly
3:06:57
braces I will add a key then a value
3:07:03
germany followed by Berlin then let's print our
3:07:08
dictionary i'll use a print statement print
3:07:14
capitals yeah and there's Germany right there using the update method we can insert a new key value pair or update an
3:07:21
existing key value pair let's also change one of the existing values with our key USA let's update the capital to
3:07:29
be Detroit yeah see the value has been updated the capital of the USA is now
3:07:37
Detroit Michigan to remove a key value pair you can use the pop method then pass in a
3:07:44
key let's remove China china no longer exists within our
3:07:50
dictionary it's gone you can remove the latest key value pair within a dictionary by using the pop item method
3:07:58
capitals do pop item with pop item you don't need to pass in a key pop item
3:08:06
will remove the latest key value pair that was inserted then we have clear
3:08:13
capitals.clear that will clear the dictionary it's pretty self-explanatory the next few methods
3:08:19
are a little tricky to explain to get all of the keys within the dictionary but not the values there is a keys
3:08:27
method capitals i think I'm going to insert this within a variable keys equals capitals keys
3:08:37
let's see what happens when we print this the keys method will return all of
3:08:43
the keys within our dictionary technically keys is an object which resembles a list i haven't discussed
3:08:49
object-oriented programming yet this is a little bit above our level if you ever need the keys in a dictionary you can
3:08:55
use the keys method one use is that we can use that within a for loop they're iterable for every key in capitals keys
3:09:05
method let's print every key if at any time you need to iterate
3:09:12
over all the keys you can use a for loop to iterate over every key that is
3:09:17
returned from the keys method of your dictionary there is also the values method to get all of the values within
3:09:25
your dictionary there is a values method values equals capitals do values
3:09:34
method then let's print our values like before with the keys method
3:09:42
the values method will return an object which resembles a list let's iterate and
3:09:47
print over every value within our dictionary for every value in capitals
3:09:54
do values print every
3:10:02
value here are all the values within our dictionary this next one is probably the
3:10:08
most tricky it is the items method capitals do items i will assign what is
3:10:14
returned to a variable named items then we will print items
3:10:22
items returns a dictionary object which resembles a 2D list of tpples it's
3:10:28
really complicated how might this be useful this time we're going to use a for loop to print every
3:10:34
key value in capitals do items
3:10:39
method we have in essence two counters this time I will print using an fstring
3:10:47
every key value pair i will print every key as well as every value in our print
3:10:56
statement so there's our dictionary laid out we have iterated over every key
3:11:01
value pair it's kind of an advanced topic but I thought I would at least bring it up now so yeah that's a
3:11:06
dictionary everybody it's a collection of key value pairs they are ordered and
3:11:11
changeable no duplicates allowed you have a bunch of different methods such as get update pop pop item clear then
3:11:19
you can get the keys the values or both which is the items method we'll be using
3:11:25
dictionaries in a few game programs we'll be making in the future and well yeah those are dictionaries in
3:11:32
Python hey everybody today we will be creating a program to mimic a concession stand much like what you would see at a
26.concession stand program
3:11:39
movie theater we will be utilizing a dictionary to keep track of a menu item and an associated price more or less
3:11:46
this is just a program to help us get used to working with dictionaries let's begin we'll create a dictionary named
3:11:53
menu what items are on the menu we'll need an item and a price i'll think of
3:11:58
some i'm going to speed up this video feel free to pause if you need more time
3:12:18
and here's my menu everybody i thought of a few food items you might find at a movie theater concession stand pizza
3:12:25
nachos popcorn fries chips soft pretzels soda lemonade movie theater popcorn is
3:12:31
really expensive for some reason okay we have our menu a user is going to select specific keys from this menu depending
3:12:38
on what the key is we can get the associated value to calculate a total to keep track of the user selected items I
3:12:45
will create an empty list named cart i will also declare a variable named total
3:12:51
to keep track of the total we need to lay this dictionary down flat to display it to a user well we do have the items
3:12:58
method of a dictionary which we covered in the last video for every key value in
3:13:05
our dictionary menu dot items method the items method of our dictionary will
3:13:12
return a key and a value during each iteration i'm simply going to print
3:13:18
every key and value i'll use an fstring i will print every key colon space then
3:13:26
a value let's take a look so far
3:13:32
here's our menu i'll make a few changes the price will be in dollars and cents
3:13:37
but feel free to pick your own unit of currency i'll preede my value with the dollar sign then using a format
3:13:44
specifier I will display two decimal places
3:13:50
2F that's better i will line up all the keys after the key I will add a format
3:13:58
specifier then allocate 10 spaces yeah look at that it's all lined
3:14:04
up now before and after displaying our menu with this for loop I will add some decorative
3:14:12
text let's say
3:14:19
menu then outside of the for loop I'll display a bunch of dashes
3:14:29
yeah look at that let's move on to the next step we will ask a user for some input
3:14:36
what item would they like to buy from the menu while our condition will be true if our condition is set to true
3:14:44
we'll need to break out of this loop one way or another we will ask for some user input food equals
3:14:53
input select an item Q2 to
3:15:02
quit if food is equal to a lowercase Q
3:15:08
then we will break let's test it select an item
3:15:16
pizza nachos soda Q to quit yeah it works okay what
3:15:24
if the user types in capital Q well we can't escape the while
3:15:29
loop if a user types in capital Q we're assuming that they would like to quit
3:15:34
when we accept our user input I'm going to add dot lower method this will take
3:15:39
our user input and make it all lowercase so we should be able to acknowledge any uppercase letters yeah
3:15:47
it works cool let's add an else- if statement what if a user types in an
3:15:54
item that's not on our menu well there is a get method of dictionaries if menu
3:16:03
get pass in our food which is user input if the user selection is not within our
3:16:10
menu as a key it will return none so we can use that else if menu.get food is
3:16:19
not none then we would like to append that food item to our
3:16:26
cart cart.append append our food
3:16:32
item so outside of the while loop I'm going to print our cart temporarily just
3:16:39
to test it okay select an item pizza
3:16:46
soda pretzel how about a potato q to quit we have our pizza soda
3:16:54
and pretzel but not our potato we don't want that in our cart because that's not on the menu yeah you can just add that
3:17:00
line else if menu item get food is not none that will complete our while loop
3:17:08
let's calculate a total for every food in our cart let's
3:17:14
take our total variable set this equal to total plus then we need a value
3:17:22
associated with a key plus
3:17:27
menu get method get the food item found within our cart but I'm going to shorten
3:17:34
this to total plus equals menu.get the value associated
3:17:41
with this food in our cart i will also display that food item print food i'm
3:17:49
going to avoid printing our food item on every line i will set the ending character in our print statement just to
3:17:56
be a space okay let's see what we have so far i would like
3:18:03
popcorn soda pretzel q to quit popcorn soda pretzel
3:18:11
then we will display the total i will print a new line
3:18:18
print I'll use an fstring total
3:18:27
is add a unit of currency total I'll add a format
3:18:32
specifier 2F to display two decimal places I'm going to add one line of
3:18:38
decorative text let's copy maybe
3:18:51
this all right let's test it
3:18:58
out select an item popcorn
3:19:05
pretzel soda potato q to quit
3:19:12
all right here's our cart popcorn pretzel soda we did not include the potato that was not found within our
3:19:18
dictionary the total is $12.50 well there you have it everybody
3:19:24
that is a concession stand program the point of this program was to help us get used to working with dictionaries a
3:19:30
dictionary is a collection of key value pairs such as an item and a price and
3:19:36
yeah that's a concession standard program in Python
27.random numbers
3:19:42
well hello again everybody it's me in today's topic I'm going to show you how we can generate some random numbers in
3:19:48
Python then at the end of this video as an exercise we're going to create a number guessing program let's begin we
3:19:55
will be importing the random module type import random the random module gives us
3:20:01
access to a lot of useful methods involving random numbers for a comprehensive list you can use the help
3:20:08
function pass in the random module and then we would want to print
3:20:15
this here's what we all have access to we have a shuffle method set state
3:20:22
seed sample random range random random int random bytes and there's a ton of
3:20:29
others but we'll discuss a few of the more useful methods for beginners for a random whole integer maybe you're
3:20:35
rolling a six-sided dice you would type the name of the random module dot then a
3:20:40
method for a random whole integer type rand int add a set of parenthesis within
3:20:47
the set of parenthesis you will list a range if I'm rolling a six-sided dice I
3:20:52
would like the numbers 1 through 6 1 6 then I will assign what is returned to
3:20:58
maybe a variable print whatever my number
3:21:05
is my random number is a four three one
3:21:10
four all right i tend to play a lot of Dungeons and Dragons we use polyhedral
3:21:15
dice that have more or less than six sides there is a 20sided dice for a
3:21:21
random number between 1 and 20 I would set the range to be 1 20 here I rolled a
3:21:28
16 and a seven and an eight within the rand int method you can place variables
3:21:34
as well as long as they contain numbers i will create a variable named low i'll set that equal to
3:21:40
one and a variable named high i will set that to be 100 i will replace the
3:21:46
numbers with my variables that behave as numbers give me a random integer between
3:21:52
my low variable and high variable so between 1 and 100 in this example I have
3:21:58
rolled a 75 now in 88 if you need a random floatingoint number you can use the
3:22:04
random method random.random then let's assign this to
3:22:09
a variable number equals the random method of the random module that would return a
3:22:17
random floatingoint number between 0 and 1 you can pick a random choice from a
3:22:23
sequence in the future we're going to create a game of rock paper scissors let's say we have a tpple of
3:22:31
options options equals
3:22:36
rock paper scissors we are accessing the random
3:22:43
module dot then use the choice method place your sequence within the choice
3:22:48
method give me a random choice from options i will store this within a
3:22:54
variable let's say option equals random choice from my options then I will print
3:23:02
the option our computer has generated scissors
3:23:07
paper rock so the choice method is a great use for games if you ever need a
3:23:13
random element now there's also shuffle this time maybe we have a deck of cards
3:23:19
cards equals I guess I'll use a list this
3:23:32
time i have a list of cards that you would normally find within a deck of playing cards well besides the suit 2
3:23:39
through 10 Jack Queen King Ace using the shuffle method I can shuffle this
3:23:45
sequence access the random module shuffle pass in your
3:23:51
sequence in my case it's cards then I will print cards yeah look at that my cards are now
3:23:59
shuffled in the future we'll be creating a game of blackjack the shuffle method will be used then to shuffle our deck of
3:24:06
cards those are a few methods found within the random module for some practice let's create a number guessing
3:24:12
game as an exercise hey everybody so today we're
28.number guessing game
3:24:18
going to create a number guessing game using Python this is a project meant for beginners by completing this project it
3:24:24
will help us reinforce our understanding of previous topics let's begin we will import the random module we'll need to
3:24:32
pick a random number the random module is going to handle that for us what is the range of random numbers for our
3:24:39
number guessing game we'll store those as variables we will have one variable named lowest
3:24:46
number i'll set that to be one as well as a variable for highest number which I
3:24:52
will set to be 100 feel free to pick a different range if you would like i'll set the range to be 1 through 100 a
3:25:00
random number will be selected between this range which will be stored within a
3:25:05
variable named answer what is the correct answer so to choose a random number between these two values we will
3:25:13
access the random module called the rand int method we
3:25:19
will choose a random integer between these two values the two arguments will be lowest
3:25:26
num highest num for the second argument let's perform a test run i will
3:25:34
print my answer the number is going to be between 1 and
3:25:43
100 okay we know that that works here's a few more
3:25:49
variables we need to keep track of the number of wrong guesses which I will store as a variable named
3:25:55
guesses we want the user to keep guessing as long as our application is
3:26:00
running we will create a boolean variable of is running which we will set
3:26:05
to be true once the user wins the game we will set is running to be
3:26:13
false we will print a welcome message let's say
3:26:19
Python number guessing
3:26:25
game we will prompt the user i'll use an fstring select a number between i'll add
3:26:35
two placeholders select a number between our
3:26:42
lowest number and our highest number python number guessing game
3:26:48
select a number between 1 and 100 now if I was to change the range of these
3:26:54
variables that should be reflected temporarily i changed the
3:26:59
lowest number to be 10 and the highest number to be 1,00 but let's set that
3:27:06
back between one and 100 is good we'll need a while loop to continue
3:27:12
the game each round we will say while is
3:27:18
running since is running is a boolean we don't need to say while is running equals true we can just say while is
3:27:26
running while this value remains true continue playing the game
3:27:31
we will ask the user for some input we will create a local variable of guess
3:27:37
guess equals use the input function then enter
3:27:42
a prompt enter your guess there's one thing we want to
3:27:50
check python number guessing game select a number between 1 and 100 enter your guess what if somebody doesn't type in a
3:27:57
number like they type in the word pizza we should let the user know that that's an invalid
3:28:04
guess we'll write the following if statement if our guess use the is digit
3:28:13
method if our guess is a digit a number then we will execute any code underneath
3:28:19
this if statement for the time being I'll write pass we'll get back to that later else we will do something
3:28:26
else let's print the following print invalid
3:28:34
guess let's copy this print statement because I'm lazy and I don't feel like typing it
3:28:40
out please select a number between our lowest
3:28:46
number and our highest number let's try that again i will guess pizza which isn't a
3:28:54
number and we get the message invalid guess please select a number between 1
3:29:00
and 100 all right that works underneath our if statement we'll write the
3:29:06
following once we get a guess that is a digit we need to convert it to a number
3:29:11
because when you accept user input it's a string we will reassign our guess
3:29:17
equal to type cast our guess as an integer
3:29:24
then increase the number of guesses by one guesses plus equals 1 because we
3:29:30
have already made one guess here's another scenario what if somebody guesses a
3:29:36
number outside of this range like one cajillion well we should give a warning
3:29:43
that that guess isn't valid if our guess is lower than the lowest
3:29:53
number or our guess is greater than the highest
3:29:59
number we will print the following that number is out of
3:30:08
range and I will reprompt the user
3:30:14
please select a number between the lowest number and the highest
3:30:20
number let's perform a test run i will guess one
3:30:25
cajillion that number is out of range please select a number between 1 and
3:30:31
100 we'll add an else if statement else if our
3:30:36
guess is less than our answer we will print the following
3:30:43
too low try
3:30:48
again else if our guess is greater than our
3:30:55
answer we will print to high try again if our guess
3:31:03
isn't less than our answer and our guess isn't greater than our answer that means we must have the correct answer within
3:31:11
an else statement we will print i'll use an F
3:31:16
string correct the answer was insert our answer
3:31:24
our answer variable then print the number of guesses it
3:31:29
took number of guesses add a placeholder place in our guesses within
3:31:37
the placeholder now to escape the while loop we will take our boolean variable of is running which is normally true and
3:31:45
set that to be false to escape and that should be all we need let's run this one last
3:31:51
time python number guessing game select a number between 1 and 100 let's select
3:31:57
a number right in the middle 50 too low try again so the number is between 50
3:32:03
and 100 75 too high it's between 50 and 75
3:32:10
then 62 too high
3:32:18
56 53 55 correct the answer was 55 number of
3:32:26
guesses it took me six all right everybody that is a Python number guessing game you yourself can
3:32:33
create as a mini project hey everybody in today's topic I thought
29.rock, paper, scissors game
3:32:39
we would create a game of rock paper scissors now that we know how the random module works let's begin by importing
3:32:46
the random module we will create some options we will use a tpple we're not
3:32:52
going to be changing the options so a tpple would be better than a list we have three options
3:32:59
rock paper or scissors
3:33:05
i'll create a variable named player to store the player's choice for now I'm
3:33:10
going to set this to be none as well as a computer our computer is going to pick
3:33:15
a random choice from these options rock paper or scissors in order to do so we
3:33:21
can use the choice method of the random module
3:33:26
random.choice pick a random choice from options
3:33:32
let's have the player enter in some input enter
3:33:40
a choice
3:33:45
rock paper scissors then we will display the
3:33:52
player's choice and the computer's choice i'll use an
3:33:58
fstring player colon space the variable
3:34:04
player let's copy that paste it then change player to
3:34:12
computer let's see what we have so far enter a choice rock paper
3:34:18
scissors so I pick rock the computer picks scissors let's try it again just
3:34:24
for good measure i pick paper this time the computer picks scissors i pick scissors the computer
3:34:31
picks paper okay we know that the computer is successfully picking a random choice from our options now what
3:34:38
if the player picks something that's not within this tpple such as the gun well
3:34:44
we would want to stop that right we need the user to pick a valid option only rock paper or scissors i think what
3:34:51
we'll do is that when we accept the user input let's place it within a while loop so indent this
3:34:57
line while this condition is going to be kind of weird while our player variable
3:35:04
is not in our tpple options let's try
3:35:10
this again to see what happens i pick the gun enter a choice all right well if
3:35:15
I can't pick a gun how about a sponge well I can't pick that either rock that
3:35:22
works our condition is while the player variable is not found within our options
3:35:29
if the player doesn't pick one of these options this while loop will continue forever once we pick something that's
3:35:36
within our options we then escape the while loop let's check some win conditions now if the player is equal to
3:35:45
computer that means it's a tie i will print it's a
3:35:52
tie i'll add a few else if statements else if the player is equal to rock I'll
3:36:01
use the and logical operator and the computer is equal to
3:36:08
scissors that means you win let's print you win let's add another
3:36:16
condition else if the player picks paper and the
3:36:25
computer picks rock then you also win you
3:36:34
win l if the player picks
3:36:40
scissors and the computer and the computer picks
3:36:48
paper then we will print you win
3:36:55
else if the player's choice is not the same as the computers and we don't meet
3:37:01
any win conditions that must mean we lose print you
3:37:08
lose let's see if this works enter a choice rock paper scissors i pick the
3:37:13
gun nope I can't pick that i pick rock i pick rock the computer picks scissors
3:37:19
you win let me see if I can lose i'll pick paper you win
3:37:25
again scissors i need to stop winning i need to see if the lose condition
3:37:31
works okay it's a tie at least but I need to lose all right there we go i pick rock
3:37:38
the computer picks paper you lose what if the user would like to play again
3:37:43
let's place all of this code within a while loop let's do so right about here
3:37:49
now I'm not going to write while true like I normally do this time I'm going
3:37:54
to create a variable let's say running is our game running i will set that to be
3:38:02
true while running equals true or we
3:38:07
could shorten this to just while running that's simpler i will place all of this code
3:38:14
within the while loop to mass indent some code just highlight all of the code then press tab hey everybody this is Bro
3:38:21
from the future i forgot to explain something the reason I'm not setting the condition of my while loop to be true is
3:38:28
that if you have a lot of code within a while loop it can be really difficult to find where the break statement is if I
3:38:34
set my condition to be a boolean variable such as running it's a lot easier to find any instance where I use
3:38:41
this variable if I were to highlight it we can see that running is found down here if I need to change any instance of
3:38:47
this variable and rename it to something you can refactor let's rename running as
3:38:53
maybe playing then I will refactor so my variable running is now playing and that
3:39:00
change was made down here too so it's a coding preference every time we start a new game I will reset the player as well
3:39:07
as the computer let's move these two lines into the while loop at the beginning so when we start a new game we
3:39:15
will reset the player the computer will pick a new random choice so let's see what we have so
3:39:21
far rock i pick rock the computer picks rock it's a tie then we have to play
3:39:28
again so paper you lose scissors it's a
3:39:33
tie now what if we would like to escape the while loop after our win conditions
3:39:38
i'm going to create a temporary variable let's name this play again then we will
3:39:44
ask for some user input play
3:39:51
again y slashn meaning yes or no if the user
3:39:56
types in something that's capital I'm going to use the lower method to make it lowerase so if our play again variable
3:40:05
is equal to Y we would like to escape what I would
3:40:11
like to do is I would like to see if the player types in something that's not Y i
3:40:16
will preede this condition with the not logical operator if the user does not
3:40:24
want to play again then let's take our boolean variable running normally it's true
3:40:31
and set that to be false running equals false that means we will escape the
3:40:37
while loop once we escape the while loop I will
3:40:42
print thanks for playing now I'm going to change this momentarily i just want to test it
3:40:50
rock play again yes paper play again
3:40:55
yes scissors you lose play again nope thanks
3:41:00
for playing this is entirely optional i try and create as few variables as possible i would personally rather avoid
3:41:08
creating a variable here another way in which I could write this is that I can get rid of this
3:41:18
variable let's move if not in front of the
3:41:23
input and follow our input here then use the comparison operator
3:41:31
then add a colon if the user's input after making it lowercase does not equal a Y for yes set
3:41:41
running to be false so that should work the same rock play again yes enter a choice
3:41:50
paper play again no thanks for playing this line would work the same but it's a
3:41:56
little more complex for beginners to read or you can use the other method that I showed you all right everybody
3:42:02
well that's a game of rock paper scissors hello everybody today we will
30.dice roller program
3:42:08
be creating a dice roller program in Python we will be utilizing some ASI art
3:42:13
i'll post all of the ASI art that we'll need in the description of this video you can copy and paste it to save time
3:42:19
if you'd like all right let's get started everybody we will begin by importing the random module because we
3:42:26
will be rolling some random numbers between 1 through six if we're going to create some ASI art we'll be utilizing
3:42:32
Unicode characters to enter in a Unicode character it really varies depending on your operating system i think the
3:42:39
easiest way would just be to use Python to enter a Unicode character type a forward slash then a given code for each
3:42:46
character here are all of the codes that we'll need
3:42:58
after writing these seven unic code characters let's run this program these symbols that are output let's copy them
3:43:06
i'll add them to a comment then we can delete this line these are the unic code
3:43:11
characters we'll need to build some ASI art some dice each die will be made out
3:43:17
of five lines let's begin with the first we'll need a
3:43:23
left corner nine dashes then the right
3:43:30
corner for the second line copy this vertical bar add nine
3:43:38
spaces then a vertical bar we can copy this whole line paste it two times
3:43:46
let's use the left bottom corner add a nine of these
3:43:52
dashes then the bottom right corner and here's a basic box shape
3:43:58
depending on what the number die is we can add one of these bullet points for a one we can add that right to the middle
3:44:04
so that's good for now we'll delete this later let's create a dictionary i will name this dictionary dice art our
3:44:14
dictionary is made out of key value pairs so the keys will be the numbers 1 through six beginning with one the value
3:44:23
will be a tpple it's a dictionary made out of key value pairs where the value
3:44:29
is a tpple within the tpple let's add these lines each separated with a comma
3:44:47
i'm going to format these so they form a box shape let's take our bullet point place
3:44:55
it right in the middle then add a comma to the end of this key value pair that
3:45:00
is the first key value pair let's copy all of this paste it again change one to two
3:45:08
let's move this bullet point we need two bullet points about right here and here
3:45:15
let's repeat this process for keys three through six
3:45:43
be sure to get rid of the comma at the end and here is our dictionary of dice
3:45:48
art each key is a number each value is a tuple made of
3:45:54
strings let's create a list of dice our dice will be numbers randomly generated
3:46:01
between 1 and six a total to calculate the total i'll set that to be
3:46:07
zero then we will ask a user for a number of
3:46:13
dice this will be some input how many
3:46:20
dice then type cast the input as an integer we don't want somebody to write
3:46:26
you know 2.5 dice you can't roll half a dice to generate a random number you can use the rand int method of the random
3:46:34
module we need a random number between one and six then we need to append this
3:46:40
number to our list of dice dice.append then we can move this line
3:46:47
to within the append method we need to do this a number of
3:46:52
times depending on how many dice the user enters in we can place this line within a for loop
3:46:59
for every die in our
3:47:05
range number of dice this will be a number let's print our list of dice to
3:47:11
see what numbers we have in here how many dice i would like five dice 5 3 3 4
3:47:18
6 okay we know that that works let's calculate a total we'll need to iterate
3:47:24
and sum all of the elements within our list we can do that with the for loop for every die in our list dice take
3:47:35
our total variable plus equals the current value within our
3:47:42
dice then we will print a total i'll use an fstring total colon
3:47:49
space our total variable let's see what we have so
3:47:56
far how many dice i would like five dice our total is 19 now between these two
3:48:02
for loops we will display our ASI art the easiest way would be to create some
3:48:08
nested for loops the outer for loop will be in charge of the number of
3:48:13
dice for every die in our
3:48:18
range number of dice
3:48:24
the inner for loop will be in charge of printing every
3:48:30
tpple for every line in then to get a
3:48:36
value in our dictionary we would type the name of the dictionary dice art then
3:48:41
use the get method what are we getting we're getting a value at a given key let's take our
3:48:49
list of numbers dice at index of die our
3:48:55
counter depending on what the user types in for the number of dice die will begin at one then
3:49:01
increment within the inner for loop we will print the line so let's take a look
3:49:10
how many dice I would like three dice and here's our asky art 6 + 2 + 4 that
3:49:16
equals 12 if you would prefer we can display all of these dice on a single horizontal
3:49:24
line instead of one vertical line it's a little more tricky though if you would prefer that approach let's turn this
3:49:31
chunk of code into comments we will write this nested loop
3:49:36
a little different so each tpple is made up of five elements right
3:49:43
so if we're printing a horizontal line let's say we roll the numbers 1 through three we would first need to
3:49:50
display this line of the first dice then the first line of the second dice then
3:49:56
the first line of the third dice during the next iteration of the outer loop we
3:50:02
would display the second line of the first dice the second line of the second dice the second line of the third dice
3:50:10
so it's a little more complex let's create an outer loop that will iterate five times for every line in
3:50:18
range five then the nested loop will be for
3:50:23
every die in dice how many dice do we have within our
3:50:33
list we will print we're going to get one of the values found at one of the
3:50:38
numbers that we roll take our dictionary of dice
3:50:45
art get then a number 1 through six that will be the value found within
3:50:52
our list of dice get the current die remember that this is a number 1 through
3:50:58
six we would then need one of the elements found within our tpple so get
3:51:03
the first line then the second line third fourth fifth
3:51:11
so let's add the index operator place our counter of line
3:51:16
within the index operator let's see what we have so far we need to add one more thing how
3:51:22
many dice three this is an abomination there's one
3:51:27
more change we need to make at the end of our print statement let's set the ending character to be an
3:51:35
empty string and that should fix that how many dice three okay we're getting better
3:51:42
results then when we escape the inner loop we will print a new line how many dice
3:51:49
three and there we are 3 + 6 + 1 is 10
3:51:55
all right everybody so that is a dice roller program it is kind of complex but
3:52:00
I thought this might be a good exercise if you would like a copy of this code I will post all of this in the comment
3:52:05
section down below and well yeah that's a dice roller program in
3:52:11
Python hey everybody today I need to explain functions think of a function as a block of reusable code to invoke a
31.functions
3:52:19
function you place a set of parenthesis after the function name to invoke it here's a scenario i need to sing happy
3:52:26
birthday three times i know it's a weird example but it makes a lot of sense just trust me on this if I need to sing happy
3:52:33
birthday three times I would write something like this i'm going to create my own version of the happy birthday
3:52:45
song this is one verse if I need to repeat this code three times without
3:52:50
using functions I could either repeat this code or maybe place it within a
3:52:56
loop so here's my happy birthday song three times but there's a better way of handling this that doesn't involve
3:53:02
repeating our code or using loops what if I could write this code once then
3:53:08
reuse it whenever I need to that's where functions come in to define a function you would type def then a unique
3:53:15
function name let's name this function the happy birthday function add a set of
3:53:21
parenthesis a colon any code that belongs to the function you'll want to indent underneath then to invoke this
3:53:28
function I would type the name of the function happy birthday add a set of
3:53:34
parenthesis and that's it when you invoke this function you will execute this code once if I need to
3:53:42
execute this code three times I would just call it two more times happy birthday happy birthday
3:53:48
happy birthday to invoke a function you type the function name then add a set of parenthesis i like to think of the
3:53:54
parenthesis as a pair of telephones talking to each other you call a function to invoke it hey happy birthday
3:54:00
function execute your code with functions you are able to send data directly to a function using what are
3:54:07
known as arguments you can send values or variables directly to a function place any data within the set of
3:54:13
parenthesis i'll send my function a first name any data you send a function are known as arguments but you need a
3:54:21
matching set of parameters that are in order what exactly is the data we're sending in well it's a name i will add
3:54:28
one parameter to my happy birthday function i will name this data name a parameter is kind of like a temporary
3:54:35
variable that's used within a function i'm going to replace this instance of u with a name i will use an
3:54:43
fstring replace U with a placeholder i will add my parameter name so happy
3:54:50
birthday to bro we could pass in some other names what about
3:54:57
Steve and Joe here we are happy birthday to bro
3:55:04
happy birthday to Steve happy birthday to Joe when you invoke a function you can send more than one argument let's
3:55:11
send an age this time i'll send 20 30 and 40 but when I run this we have an
3:55:21
error we're passing in two arguments but our function is set up only to take one
3:55:27
i would need a matching number of arguments to invoke this function we will need two parameters we have a name
3:55:34
and we have an age then let's use this age you are
3:55:40
let's make this line an F string age years old let's try that
3:55:49
again happy birthday to bro you are 20 years old happy birthday to Steve you
3:55:55
are 30 years old happy birthday to Joe you are 40 years old when you invoke a function you can pass in some data those
3:56:02
are known as arguments but you'll need a matching set of parameters the order does matter let's see what happens when
3:56:09
I switch these two parameters age then
3:56:14
name happy birthday 220 you are bro years old happy birthday 230 you are
3:56:20
Steve years old happy birthday 240 you are Joe years old so the position of the
3:56:26
parameters does matter same thing goes with the arguments you also could name these parameters something unique maybe
3:56:33
X and Y happy birthday to X you are Years old
3:56:39
that's also valid let's try another example i'm going to create a function to display an
3:56:48
invoice there will be three parameters a username an amount and a due
3:56:57
date let's print hello i should make this an F string
3:57:08
username we'll use another fing your bill
3:57:16
of amount let's precede this placeholder
3:57:21
with the unit of currency i will also add a format specifier
3:57:27
2F is due on our due date whatever that
3:57:33
parameter is to invoke this function we will type the function's name add a set
3:57:38
of parenthesis a username an amount and a due date let's make up some username an
3:57:46
amount I guess $42.50 i'm just making up a number here then a due date the 1st of January
3:57:55
I guess here's my invoice hello bro code your bill of $42.50 50 cents is due on
3:58:01
January 1st let's change these arguments joe Schmo is the username he owes $100
3:58:09
and one penny due on the 1st of February or January 2nd depending on how you read
3:58:16
dates in your region hello Joe Mo your bill of $1001 is due on 1/2 that's another
3:58:24
example now we need to explain the return statement return is a statement that is used to end a function and send
3:58:31
a result back to the caller here's an example we have a variable Z z will
3:58:37
equal we'll invoke a function to add two numbers together such as the numbers 1
3:58:43
and two when we invoke a function we can send some data back after adding 1 and
3:58:49
two we will send the result which would be three then this value can be assigned
3:58:55
to a variable then we can print whatever Z is so let's create some functions
3:59:00
let's create a function to add two numbers together the parameters will be X and
3:59:07
Y let's say Z equals X + Y then we will
3:59:15
return our value Z so I'm not going to print Z directly right
3:59:20
now let's subtract X and Y subtract Z = X - Y return
3:59:30
Z multiply X *
3:59:38
Y then
3:59:44
divide x / Y return Z let's invoke our add function pass in two numbers one and
3:59:51
two then I'm going to print the result after adding these two numbers
3:59:58
together the result is three what about
4:00:03
subtract subtract 1 and two the result is
4:00:08
-1 multiply the result is
4:00:15
two then divide 1 / 2 is 0.5 after we resolve
4:00:23
this function a value is returned just imagine that after we finish this function this function becomes whatever
4:00:29
is returned three this function becomes -1 this function becomes two this
4:00:36
function becomes 0.5 let's write something a little more
4:00:42
complex we will create a function to create a full name
4:00:47
create name we'll need two parameters for a first name and a last name i'll
4:00:53
name these first and last what do we want to do within this function let's capitalize the user's
4:01:00
first name first equals first dot capitalize
4:01:05
method then do the same thing with the last name last equals last capitalize
4:01:15
then I'm going to return the user's first name plus their last name then
4:01:20
I'll add a space in between their first and last name this is also valid outside of the
4:01:26
function let's create a full name variable then invoke the create name
4:01:32
function so this function is going to capitalize the first and last name for us i'll type in my first name all
4:01:39
lowercase same thing with my last name then let's print our full
4:01:47
name and here is my full name variable we sent our function some arguments we
4:01:53
have some parameters set up we took those values made them uppercase then concatenated these strings together then
4:02:00
returned them as a single string let's try this with a different name
4:02:05
spongebob Squarepants spongebob now has a full
4:02:11
name the first and last names are now capitalized using the return statement you can return some data back to the
4:02:18
place in which you call a function well everybody that's a function it's a
4:02:23
section of reusable code to call a function you type the function's name add a set of parenthesis you can send a
4:02:30
function some data which are known as arguments but you'll need a matching set of parameters you also do have the
4:02:37
option of returning some data back to the place in which you invoke a function we'll be using functions a lot in the
4:02:43
future but we will get more practice with them and those are functions in
4:02:49
Python hey everybody today I'm going to explain default arguments default
32.default arguments
4:02:54
arguments are a default value for certain parameters the default is used
4:02:59
when that argument is omitted when you invoke a function in the last topic we discussed positional arguments today we
4:03:06
will be examining default arguments then in future topics we'll examine keyword and arbitrary arguments let's begin
4:03:14
let's define a function to calculate net price there will be three parameters an
4:03:21
original list price a discount if there is one and
4:03:26
sales tax we will return a net price and here's
4:03:33
the formula list price times 1 minus our discount
4:03:42
percentage times 1 + our sales tax maybe
4:03:48
I'm buying a PlayStation 5 for $500 i will pass in 500 for the list
4:03:54
price well I can't actually execute this function without also passing in an
4:03:59
argument for discount and tax perhaps the discount is zero and the sales tax
4:04:04
is 5% 0.05 well this would work and I should probably put this within a print
4:04:11
statement so you can see it there we are my total is
4:04:16
$525 the list price of $500 no discount and 5% sales tax now suppose that maybe
4:04:24
90% of the time when we're executing this function most of the time discount is zero and our sales tax is almost
4:04:31
always the same what we could do to make this function a little more flexible is to set these two parameters to have a
4:04:38
default value in place of sending in three arguments we can pass in one then
4:04:43
set our discount and our tax to have a default value so I will set discount to
4:04:48
be zero and tax to be 0.05 meaning 5% so
4:04:54
this function would work our total is 525 and that's assuming that our
4:05:00
discount is zero and our tax is 5% the nice thing about using default arguments
4:05:05
is that let's say that somebody has a discount well this function would also accept up to two additional
4:05:12
arguments so let's print our net
4:05:17
price 500 and our customer has a coupon for 10% off i'll add a second argument
4:05:23
of 0.1 if we're passing in an argument for
4:05:29
our discount we'll use whatever is passed in rather than the default our total now is
4:05:36
$472.50 or maybe this time they are not paying sales tax i
4:05:42
will set the sales tax to be zero now the customer's total is
4:05:47
$450 so that's kind of the nice thing about default arguments it makes your functions more flexible and it can
4:05:53
reduce the number of arguments especially if the arguments that you're passing in tend to be consistent most of
4:05:58
the time people don't have a discount and almost everybody is paying 5% sales tax why pass in arguments we don't have
4:06:05
to let's cover an exercise we'll create a count up timer we will import the time
4:06:12
module we will define this function define count there will be two arguments
4:06:19
start and end for X in
4:06:27
range start comma end within the range
4:06:33
function the second argument is exclusive so I'm going to add one to the end of our
4:06:39
time then I will print x to make this thread that's running the program sleep
4:06:45
you can access the time modules sleep method pass in one for 1 second then
4:06:52
outside of the for loop let's print the word done to invoke this function I need to
4:06:59
pass in two arguments a start time and an end time i'll set the start time to
4:07:05
be zero the end time to be 10 10 seconds so we start at zero then we will
4:07:11
increment by one every second i'll speed up the video i think you get the idea but we'll stop at
4:07:20
10 let's assume that most of the time a user would like to begin at zero well we
4:07:25
don't necessarily need to pass that in as an argument let's set our start parameter to have a default value of
4:07:31
zero we only need to pass in one argument but we do have a problem non-default
4:07:38
arguments should follow default arguments so if you use any default
4:07:44
arguments you'll want to be sure that they're after any positional arguments so let's reverse
4:07:50
these and that should work so now when I run this program it's
4:07:55
assuming we'd like to start at zero but we'll need to pass in an ending
4:08:01
amount of seconds when do we want to stop that works the same but now we do
4:08:07
have the option of starting at a different number this time let's end at 30 but we will begin at
4:08:16
15 we're beginning at 15 then we will count to 30 i'll speed up the
4:08:26
video there we are all right everybody so in conclusion default arguments they
4:08:31
are default values for certain parameters the default value is used when an argument is omitted they can
4:08:38
make your functions more flexible and reduce the number of arguments you have to pass in especially if those arguments
4:08:44
are consistent most of the time so those are default arguments and in the next topic we will discuss keyword arguments
4:08:50
and well yeah those are default arguments in Python
33.keyword arguments 🗝️
4:08:56
hey friends it's me again today I'm going to explain keyword arguments a keyword argument is an argument preceded
4:09:03
by an identifier it has a few benefits it helps with readability and the order of the arguments doesn't matter if
4:09:10
they're keywords keyword arguments are one of four basic styles of arguments we
4:09:15
discussed positional default then next we'll discuss arbitrary but today we'll be focusing on keyword suppose I have a
4:09:22
function to display a message like a greeting i will name this function the
4:09:27
hello function we will need a greeting a title Mr Mrs doctor a first
4:09:36
name then a last name all I'm going to do within this function
4:09:41
is print anstring i will print my
4:09:47
greeting the user's title first
4:09:54
name last name then to invoke the hello function I
4:09:59
will need to pass in four arguments a greeting a title a first name and a last
4:10:04
name so for my greeting let's say hello the title will be
4:10:13
mister the first name will be Spongebob last name
4:10:20
Squarepants so you know this does work we're currently using positional arguments the position of these
4:10:26
arguments does matter so what if I were to switch these around we have hello
4:10:32
Spongebob Squarepants followed by mister hello Spongebob Squarepants mister an
4:10:38
optional feature when sending arguments to a function is that we could turn these into keyword arguments prefix any
4:10:45
arguments with the name of the parameter followed by equals title equals
4:10:51
mister first equals Spongebob last equals Squarepants then
4:10:57
with these keyword arguments the order really doesn't matter maybe we move the first name to the
4:11:04
end and the still would print out is the same thing we have title first name last name if you're mixing and matching
4:11:11
positional arguments and keyword arguments you want to be sure that the positional arguments are first so if I
4:11:17
was to move the string our greeting to the end well this technically wouldn't work
4:11:24
we have a syntax error positional arguments follow keyword arguments so make sure any positional arguments are
4:11:31
first before using any keyword arguments two helpful benefits of using keyword
4:11:36
arguments is that it helps with readability and the order of the arguments doesn't matter we know what
4:11:41
this argument is as well as these two title last name first
4:11:46
name let's say we have a first name and a last name john James
4:11:56
these two names kind of sound like first names is our first name John or is it James we could use keyword arguments to
4:12:03
clarify which is which you thought John was the first name but it's actually the last name and the first name is
4:12:11
James then our title is still the same hello Mr james John let's cover
4:12:17
another example i'm going to print the numbers 1 through 10 using a for loop for x in range 1 11
4:12:28
because the second argument is exclusive then I will print
4:12:33
x after each print statement we print a new line do you remember in previous topics how we would follow our print
4:12:40
statement with comma and then a new character such as a space while end is a
4:12:49
keyword argument found within the built-in print statement in place of ending each print statement with a new
4:12:55
line we are using this keyword argument of end and sending it to be a space another one is separate that's
4:13:02
found within the print statement maybe we have some numbers they're all separate
4:13:12
strings the numbers 1 through 5 i can use the separate keyword argument then
4:13:18
separate each of these strings with a given character or characters i will separate each of these strings with a
4:13:25
dash a lot of built-in functions such as the print function they have some keyword arguments you can use let's go
4:13:33
over an exercise now we're going to create a function to generate a phone number but we'll need
4:13:39
to pass in a country code area code the first three digits and the last four digits let's define this function as
4:13:46
define get phone to get a phone number we have a country
4:13:53
code area code first meaning first few digits then
4:14:00
last meaning last few digits we will return an
4:14:05
fstring we will place our country code first dash then our area
4:14:13
code dash the first few digits dash the
4:14:19
last few digits my phone number phone num equals
4:14:25
I will invoke the get phone number function we just created but we'll need a country
4:14:32
code an area code first few digits then last few
4:14:39
digits and remember the order doesn't necessarily matter usually I try and be
4:14:44
consistent with the order of the parameters make up a phone number i'm in the United States my country code is 1
4:14:51
area code 1 2 3 the next few digits will be 456 the
4:14:57
last few will be 7890 then let's print this phone number print phone
4:15:05
num and here is my phone number although you can change it up based on how you do
4:15:10
phone numbers in your country this is typically how you would see a phone number in the United States all right
4:15:16
everybody so those are keyword arguments they are just arguments preceded by an
4:15:21
identifier that matches the name of a function's parameters it does help with readability and the order of the
4:15:27
arguments doesn't matter when invoking a function it could be helpful to identify some of these arguments and well
4:15:34
everybody those are keyword arguments in Python hello friends it's me again today
34.args & **kwargs
4:15:42
I need to explain arbitrary arguments arbitrary meaning a varying amount of arguments we don't know how many
4:15:48
arguments the user is going to pass in when they invoke a function to accept a varying amount of arguments developers
4:15:54
tend to use these parameters of args and quarks args means arguments quarks means
4:16:01
keyword arguments you would want to prefix each of these parameters with the
4:16:06
unpacking operator which is an asterisk when you invoke a function that has args or quarks as parameters you will pack
4:16:13
all of those arguments into a tpple if it's args or a dictionary if the
4:16:18
parameter is quarks let's go over an example i will create a function to add
4:16:23
two numbers together define add function there will be two
4:16:29
parameters a comma b all I'm going to do is return a +
4:16:37
b I will invoke this function pass in two arguments because we have two parameters set up one 2 then I'm going
4:16:45
to print the result big surprise there my function
4:16:50
return three all right well what if I would like to pass in three parameters this time well I can no longer use this
4:16:58
function the add function takes two positional arguments but three were given i could modify this function so
4:17:05
that it could accept a varying amount of arguments any amount i'm going to replace the parameters with asterisk
4:17:13
then the word args meaning arguments so when we use the unpacking operator
4:17:18
what's going to happen now is that with the arguments that we pass into this function we will pack them all into a
4:17:24
tpple and if you don't believe me let's test it i'm going to print the type of
4:17:31
args then I'm going to remove this print statement for now my parameter args is a tpple that I
4:17:38
could work with we can use the built-in methods of this tpple or we could iterate over it
4:17:44
i'm going to iterate over this tpple for every arg in args for every argument in
4:17:53
arguments what we'll do is create a variable named total to keep track of the
4:17:58
total total plus equals the current arg that we're iterating over then at the
4:18:05
end I will return the total let's print the result print add
4:18:11
these three numbers together there we are my total is six then we can pass in
4:18:17
any amount of arguments four this time maybe five or even
4:18:24
one with my parameter args you can change this name to something else like
4:18:29
nums meaning numbers for every num in
4:18:35
nums total plus equals num this would work too the name of the parameter isn't
4:18:42
as important as the unpacking operator just by typical naming conventions people tend to stick with args but the
4:18:49
parameter name can vary let's try a different example let's create a function to display somebody's name
4:18:56
display name we will accept a varying amount of arguments use the unpacking operator
4:19:04
then follow the unpacking operator with the unique parameter name for every arg
4:19:10
in args let's print each argument then replace the ending
4:19:17
character of my print statement with a space now sometimes people can have a
4:19:23
varying number of names in their full name there can be a first name middle name last name maiden name a title etc
4:19:30
so I'm going to pass in just a first name and a last name
4:19:38
spongebob Squarepants if I need to add a middle
4:19:43
name I can do that spongebob Herald Squarepants or a
4:19:50
title Dr spongebob Herald
4:19:56
Squarepants the third Yeah as I was saying with the unpacking
4:20:03
operator followed by a unique parameter name you can pack all of these arguments
4:20:08
into a tuple which you can use within this function now let's discuss quarks
4:20:15
you use two unpacking operators then typically people follow this with the word quarks meaning keyword arguments it
4:20:23
allows you to pass multiple keyword arguments which we discussed in the last topic i think this would be great for an
4:20:30
address define print address
4:20:36
function use double asterisks then we can add a parameter name but people
4:20:41
usually stick with quarks meaning keyword arguments just as a placeholder
4:20:47
I'm going to type pass pass doesn't do anything i want this program to be able to run we'll get back to this function
4:20:52
momentarily i'm going to invoke this function print
4:20:58
address then pass in multiple keyword arguments with an address you would
4:21:03
typically have a street a
4:21:09
city state depending on what country you live in you may have more or less of
4:21:14
these keyword arguments i live in the United States we have a state then a zip
4:21:21
code okay my street will be I'm just making something up here one two three
4:21:26
fake street city will be
4:21:32
Detroit state Michigan zip code 5 43 2 1 just to make this look
4:21:41
better I'm going to place each of these keyword arguments on a new line for me that's just more readable but you do you
4:21:47
when I pass in these keyword arguments we will pack them into a dictionary just to prove it let's print
4:21:55
the type of quarks look at that class
4:22:02
dictionary within this function you can treat quarks as if it's a dictionary there's a lot of built-in methods or we
4:22:09
could iterate over the keys the values or both to iterate over the values let's
4:22:14
say for every value in our dictionary quarks dot values
4:22:22
method print every value here's all the values for the keys
4:22:31
let's change this for loop to be for every key in quarks keys method print
4:22:38
every key here are the keys for both you could
4:22:43
say for every key value in quarks do
4:22:49
items method print every key actually let me turn this into an F string print every
4:22:57
key colon
4:23:03
value the items method will return key value pairs we can pass in a varying
4:23:09
amount of keyword arguments i'm going to add an apartment number apartment equals
4:23:21
100 our keyword argument of apartment was packed into a dictionary along with all these other keyword arguments so
4:23:28
that's kind of nice we can pass in a varying amount of keyword arguments let's cover an exercise we're going to
4:23:34
use both args and quarks together we will print a shipping label define
4:23:42
shipping label function the parameters will be both
4:23:47
args quarks then just for now I'm going to write pass just so that this program
4:23:53
will work for now we'll fill in the shipping label function momentarily when we invoke the shipping label function we
4:24:00
will first pass in any positional arguments followed by keyword arguments
4:24:05
and it won't work the other way around i'll prove that in a little bit so let's say we have
4:24:13
Dr spongebob
4:24:19
Squarepants the third then I'll add my keyword arguments
4:24:25
i'm going to put this on a new line street equals 1 2 3 fake street
4:24:34
apartment equals 100 city equals
4:24:44
Detroit state equals Michigan zip equals 543 2
4:24:54
1 when we invoke this function we have a mix of arbitrary positional arguments
4:25:00
and arbitrary keyword arguments this shipping label function is designed to
4:25:06
accept both you do need args first followed by quarks this program will run
4:25:12
but if we have it the other way around quarks followed by args it's not going to function properly
4:25:19
you can see that we have a syntax error with your parameters make sure
4:25:24
that your keyword arguments follow your positional arguments let's iterate over the positional arguments first for every
4:25:33
arg in args let's print each
4:25:38
arg then I will change the ending character of my print statement to be a
4:25:43
space here's the name of the user who we're shipping something to with the shipping label
4:25:50
function i will print a new line then we will iterate over all the keyword
4:25:55
arguments for every value in my dictionary quarks dot values
4:26:04
method I will print each value then I will change the ending
4:26:10
character of my print statement to be a space all right it's not looking too bad
4:26:16
so far if you were to remove some keyword arguments or some positional
4:26:22
arguments this should work still which it does i'm going to change the format
4:26:28
of this address slightly let's add our street on one line then the city state
4:26:34
and zip code on the next line let's get rid of this for loop to print the street I'm going to
4:26:41
print use an F string add a placeholder
4:26:48
quarks.get method i'm going to get the street key with this get method you'll
4:26:54
probably need to place them within single quotes because if you use double quotes Python gets confused as to where
4:27:00
this fring ends we will use single quotes let's test it all right we have a
4:27:06
street on the next line we will print the city state and zip
4:27:13
print ft string placeholder
4:27:19
quarks.get within single quotes the city I'll add another
4:27:27
placeholder quarks.get
4:27:33
state then
4:27:38
quarks.getzip let's see what we have all right not too bad
4:27:44
what if the user has an apartment keyword apartment equals number
4:27:51
100 well we should probably add that too within this top print statement I will
4:27:56
add another placeholder invoke the get method of the
4:28:01
dictionary the key we are looking for is apartment Dr spongebob Squarepants 23
4:28:08
Fake Street apartment number 100 Detroit Michigan 54321 what if our print statement is set
4:28:14
up to display a street and an apartment but the user doesn't have an
4:28:20
apartment this would display none and we don't want that i'm thinking what we'll
4:28:25
do is we'll place this print statement within an if statement what we'll check is
4:28:34
if apartment in
4:28:40
quarks if there's an apartment key in quarks our dictionary then print this
4:28:48
line else we will print just the
4:28:57
street the person doesn't have an apartment we won't print the apartment then but if they do have an apartment
4:29:04
apartment equals number 100 then we will 123 Fake Street
4:29:11
apartment number 100 here's a challenge round what if a user has a PO box let's change apartment
4:29:18
to PO box the string will be PO box number
4:29:26
100,1 i suppose I'll add an else- if statement else
4:29:33
if PO box in our dictionary
4:29:40
quarks let's print the street i'll copy this line paste
4:29:46
it followed by a second print statement
4:29:53
quarks.getp box there we are dr for Spongebob
4:30:00
Squarepants 123 Fake Street PO Box 10001 Detroit Michigan
4:30:06
54321 all right everybody those are arbitrary arguments when you invoke a function you can pass in a varying
4:30:12
amount of arguments set up your parameter to be args for a varying amount of non-keyword arguments or
4:30:19
quarks for a varying amount of keyword arguments you can set up both in your parameters which we did for this
4:30:26
exercise and well everybody those are arbitrary arguments in
4:30:32
Python hey everybody so today I got to talk about iterables in Python an
35.iterables
4:30:38
iterable it's a category any object or collection that can return its elements
4:30:43
one at a time is considered an iterable if an object or a collection is considered an iterable then it can be
4:30:50
iterated over in a loop for example let's create a list of numbers
4:30:55
numbers equals a list i'll add the numbers 1 through 5 to keep it simple
4:31:00
lists are considered iterable we can use them within a for loop in the context of
4:31:06
a for loop we're going to be given each element one at a time each element that we're working
4:31:13
with we can give a temporary nickname let's say number for every number in my
4:31:20
iterable of numbers let's just print each
4:31:26
number this will give us 1 through 5 the name of the current element in our
4:31:32
iterable should be descriptive of what we're iterating over for example I don't want to rename the current number that
4:31:38
we're working with as something like blah blah blah you know this would work but other
4:31:44
people looking over your code might not understand what a blah blah blah is and I don't blame them each element that
4:31:51
we're given from our iterable the name should be descriptive of what we're given or you might see item for every
4:31:59
item in numbers print each item that's also a good choice now you could even iterate
4:32:06
backwards by enclosing our iterable within the reversed function
4:32:12
so take our iterable of numbers and reverse it then we get the numbers 5 4 3
4:32:19
2 1 if you would rather not print each element on a new line we can replace the
4:32:24
new line character at the end of print statements with something else print is a function we can pass in a keyword
4:32:30
argument of end rather than end each line with a new line character let's end
4:32:36
with a space this will space out each of the elements or we could replace it with
4:32:41
something else or what about a dash after each element append a dash
4:32:48
character we could even add multiple characters such as a space a dash and a space if we so
4:32:55
choose it's up to you tpples are also iterable let's convert our list to a
4:33:02
tpple by enclosing our numbers within a set of parenthesis and I no longer want this
4:33:08
reversed for every number in my iterable of numbers print each number then again we
4:33:16
get the numbers 1 through 5 let's cover sets i will create a set of fruit which
4:33:24
I will name fruits for a set enclose any values within a set of curly braces let's add a
4:33:31
string of apple a string of orange a string of
4:33:37
banana and a string of coconut so with our for loop let's say
4:33:43
for every fruit in my iterable of fruits I will print each
4:33:50
fruit that would give me apple banana orange coconut now sets they're actually not
4:33:57
reversible i will attempt to enclose our iterable of fruits within the reversed
4:34:03
function here's what happens we have a type error set object is not
4:34:09
reversible sets you can't reverse let's cover strings i will
4:34:15
create a string of name type in your full name i'll use my YouTube channel
4:34:21
name for every character in my iterable of name I would like to print each
4:34:32
character maybe I would rather not have each character end with a new line i
4:34:37
will set the keyword argument of end to be a
4:34:43
space last we have dictionaries which are the most complicated let's name this
4:34:48
dictionary my dictionary dictionaries you enclose with a set of
4:34:53
curly braces kind of like a set but each element is a key value pair i will add a
4:35:00
key of A with an associated value of 1 a key of B which has a value of two a key
4:35:08
of C which has a value of three if you iterate over a dictionary
4:35:15
the dictionary is going to return all the keys but not the values we'll test that for every key in my iterable of my
4:35:25
dictionary let's print each key this would give me the keys of A B
4:35:32
and C but none of the values 1 2 or three if you need the values we're going
4:35:39
to follow this iterable of my dictionary use the built-in values method
4:35:46
this will return all the values of your dictionary as an iterable but let's rename a key as value because now we're
4:35:54
working with the values then we're given all the values 1
4:35:59
2 and three if you need both the keys and the values you're going to use the
4:36:05
items method we'll be given both a key and a
4:36:11
value make sure that the value and the key is separated with a comma
4:36:16
let's print each key followed by the value we get the key of A with its value
4:36:23
of 1 B 2 C 3 we can reformat the output
4:36:30
however we want let's use an F string i will add two placeholders let's print
4:36:35
each key equals then the value A equals 1 B= 2 C= 3 okay
4:36:46
everybody so those are iterables an object or a collection that can return its elements one at a time is considered
4:36:52
an iterable meaning that object or collection can be iterated over using a
4:36:58
loop and well everybody those are iterables in Python
36.membership operators
4:37:05
hello again so today I got to talk about membership operators in Python they are
4:37:10
the operators in and not in they're used to test whether a value or a variable is
4:37:15
found within a sequence which include but are not limited to strings lists tpples sets or dictionaries here's an
4:37:23
example i'm going to create a word a secret word let's say
4:37:29
apple i'm going to turn this into a game i will have a user guess a letter i will
4:37:35
accept some user input guess a
4:37:40
letter in the secret
4:37:46
word what I would like to do is check to see if my letter is found in my word i
4:37:53
can write the following statement if our letter in our
4:37:59
word in is going to return a boolean value of true if that letter is found or
4:38:05
false if it's not so if our letter is found I'm going to print the following
4:38:10
statement i'll use an f string there is a add a placeholder insert our
4:38:20
letter else let's print i'll use an F string our
4:38:27
letter was not found let's test this guess a letter in
4:38:34
the secret word i will guess a capital A so all these letters are uppercase do
4:38:40
take note of that is there an A there is an A let's guess a letter
4:38:46
that's not within this word such as Z z was not found the in membership operator
4:38:54
will test to see if a value or a variable is found within a sequence if
4:38:59
it is it returns true if not it returns false or for the inverse you could say
4:39:05
not in if letter is not in Word we would have to flip these statements around
4:39:19
if this value or variable is not found in this sequence it returns true
4:39:25
otherwise false so it does the opposite of in guess a letter in the secret word
4:39:31
is there an E there is an E is there a Q q was not found depending
4:39:38
on the statement you're trying to write you can use either in or not in whichever makes more sense in that
4:39:44
context let's go over another example we were searching for a value or a variable
4:39:50
found within a string let's try a set list tpples and sets are going to behave
4:39:55
similarly i will create a set of students for a set you need a set of
4:40:01
curly braces let's add a few student names such as
4:40:06
Spongebob Patrick and
4:40:12
Sandy i will have a user type in a student to search for we will accept some user
4:40:20
input enter the name of a student
4:40:26
we're going to check if our student is in our sequence of
4:40:34
students if in returns true let's print the following i'll use an f string
4:40:41
insert our student is a
4:40:47
student else we will print i'll use an fstring
4:40:53
insert that student was not
4:40:59
found enter the name of a student let's search for Spongebob
4:41:04
spongebob is a student enter the name of a student let's attempt Squidward
4:41:10
squidward was not found and much like the first example we
4:41:16
can do the opposite see if a value or a variable is not in a sequence
4:41:22
we would have to switch these statements
4:41:28
around enter the name of a student is Sandy a student sandy is a student enter
4:41:35
the name of a student is Larry a student larry was not found now we'll cover dictionaries i
4:41:43
will create a dictionary of grades student grades like a grade book
4:41:49
let's say that the student of Sandy she will be a key has a value of
4:41:57
A squidward the key of Squidward has a
4:42:03
value of B spongebob he is also a
4:42:09
key spongebob has a grade of C then Patrick
4:42:16
patrick has a grade of
4:42:22
D here is my dictionary of grades then we'll search for a student
4:42:30
student equals input enter the name of a student
4:42:38
we'll check if let me close this if our student is found within
4:42:45
grades then I will print the following we're looking for keys is
4:42:51
there a matching key if we find that student I'll make this an F string let's display the associated
4:42:58
value of that key
4:43:03
student students grade is I'll add a
4:43:09
placeholder once we find a student we have to get that value at the given
4:43:15
key to do that we'll take our dictionary of grades at index of student this will
4:43:23
retrieve the value at a given key if we don't find a student we'll
4:43:28
output the following again I'll use an fstring
4:43:34
student was not found so now if I search for a student
4:43:40
such as Spongebob we're given a grade we're given the value at that key that
4:43:46
we're searching for let's test Sandy sy's grade is A
4:43:54
squidward squidward's grade is B and Patrick
4:43:59
patrick's grade is D but Larry is not a student if I search for him well Larry
4:44:06
was not found let's go over one last
4:44:11
example we're going to create a variable of email it's going to be a string type in whatever your email is
4:44:21
brocodegmail.com i would like to see if this email is valid does it contain at
4:44:26
and a period i will write if our value of at that character is in our
4:44:37
email and a period is an email we have two conditions check if at
4:44:44
is an email and check if a period is an email if so it's a valid email then
4:44:51
we'll print valid email
4:44:57
else we will print invalid
4:45:03
email is my email valid that email is valid I'll get rid of the
4:45:11
at invalid email I'll get rid of the period following
4:45:18
Gmail that email is also invalid in this example we're checking
4:45:24
two conditions If this value is found within this sequence and this value is found
4:45:30
within this sequence all right everybody so those are membership operators in and
4:45:36
not in they will return a boolean based on whether a value or a variable is
4:45:42
found within a sequence which include but are not limited to strings lists
4:45:48
tpples sets or dictionaries and well everybody those are membership operators in Python
37.list comprehensions
4:45:56
hey what's going on everybody so in today's video I got to explain list comprehensions in Python a list
4:46:01
comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python they're compact and
4:46:07
easier to read than traditional loops basically you have to follow this formula for every value in something
4:46:14
that's iterable meaning you can loop through it check some condition then do this expression so let me give you an
4:46:21
example with using a traditional loop then you'll be able to see why a list comprehension is useful we're going to
4:46:26
create a list and double the numbers 1 through 10 doubles equals an empty list using a
4:46:35
traditional for loop we will say for every value let's say x in range 1
4:46:43
through 11 remember that in the range function the second number is exclusive this will give you the numbers 1 through
4:46:50
10 for the first iteration x is going to be 1 then two 3 all the way up until 10
4:46:56
so we'll iterate 10 times during each iteration I'm going to take my list of
4:47:02
doubles use the built-in append method we will append x during each iteration
4:47:09
that's going to be the value times two so if I were to print my list of doubles
4:47:17
here's the result we have the numbers 1 through 10 all doubled 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 so
4:47:26
this is a lot to write we can use a list comprehension to make this code more compact and easier to read here's how we
4:47:35
need a name for this list let's say doubles equals an empty list within our
4:47:40
list we'll follow this formula we have an expression for value in
4:47:49
iterable and optionally we can check a condition we'll do this in exercises later on in this topic we'll begin with
4:47:56
for every value let's say x in our iterable our iterable is going to be a
4:48:04
range 1 through 10 again for the first iteration x will be 1 then the second
4:48:11
iteration x will be two all the way up until 10 during each iteration what would we like to do with x our value
4:48:19
let's take x multiply it by two and return it then if I was to print my list of
4:48:27
doubles we have the numbers 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 for every value in this
4:48:34
iterable do this multiply it by two this is a list comprehension it's a concise
4:48:40
way to create lists in Python we'll go over a few exercises so this time we will triple
4:48:47
each number we'll create a list of triples equals let's say this time for
4:48:53
every y in range 1 through 10 so we have to write
4:49:00
11 take y and multiply it by three then
4:49:06
we will print our list of triples 3 6 9 12 15 18 so on and so forth let's square
4:49:13
each number we'll create a list of squares for every Z in range 1 through
4:49:23
10 to square a number we take that number multiply it by itself
4:49:30
so the numbers 1 through 10 squared is 1 4 9 16 15 36 49 64 81 100
4:49:40
so 10 * 10 is 100 now we're going to work with strings we'll create a list of fruits
4:49:48
equals let's think of some fruit these are all going to be strings apple
4:49:54
orange banana coconut i'm going to take each string in this
4:50:00
list and make it uppercase we could assign this to a new list such as uppercase
4:50:07
fruits or we can simply just reassign it just to keep it simple I'll reassign
4:50:13
it so again we're following this formula i like to begin with the four value in
4:50:19
iterable portion for every fruit in our iterable of fruits what do we want to do
4:50:28
well let's take each fruit take each fruit use the built-in upper method to make it
4:50:34
uppercase then I'm going to print my list of
4:50:40
fruits each string in this list is now all uppercase you could even cut down on
4:50:46
one of the steps with our iterable of fruits I will place this
4:50:54
list and this does work too although I do find this a little more difficult to read but you can take either option how
4:51:02
about instead of making each string uppercase we'll take the first letter of each string then put it within a new
4:51:09
list so let's take each fruit at index of zero that will give us the first
4:51:15
letter we'll place it within a new list of fruit chars meaning
4:51:23
characters here's the result a O B C for every fruit in our list of fruits return
4:51:31
the first character of each string a O B C now we'll work with
4:51:40
conditions we'll create a list of numbers both negative and positive numbers equals let's say 1 -2 3 -4 5
4:51:53
-6 we'll create a list comprehension to create a new list where all of the numbers are positive our new list will
4:52:01
be positive nums equals we'll write a list comprehension for every let's say num in
4:52:12
numbers we'll write a condition return this number if our
4:52:19
num is greater than or equal to zero we do need an expression if we're not
4:52:25
modifying each value we can just return the value of
4:52:31
num during this exercise we're more focused on the if condition rather than
4:52:36
the expression if our value of num meets this condition simply return it and
4:52:41
place it within this new list let's print our list of positive
4:52:47
numbers and we have 135 let's do this with negative numbers
4:52:53
i'll just copy what we have and change a few things around this list will be negative numbers negative
4:53:00
nums for every num in numbers check this condition check to see if num is less
4:53:07
than zero if so return that number let's print our list of negative numbers -2 -4
4:53:16
-6 let's check to see if there's any even numbers even nums equals for every num in
4:53:26
numbers check to see if our num is divisible by two and we can do that with
4:53:33
the modulus operator followed by two the modulus operator will give you the remainder of any division if our number
4:53:40
is even number modulus 2 will equal zero if it's even this is going to equal zero
4:53:47
if it's odd it's going to be one we're not modifying our value we're just going to return our
4:53:55
number our list of even numbers should be -2 -4
4:54:00
-6 let me add one more value let's add positive
4:54:06
8 -24 -6 pos 8 maybe we'll add one
4:54:12
more -7 okay let's find any odd numbers let's
4:54:18
copy this line of code replace even numbers with odd numbers if num modulus 2 is equal to
4:54:27
1 that means that number doesn't divide by two evenly then we'll print our odd
4:54:34
numbers 1 3 5 - 7 all these numbers are odd here's the last
4:54:43
exercise we'll create a list of grades
4:54:48
we'll create a new list of any grades that are considered passing meaning they scored 60 or above so let's say one
4:54:55
student has a grade of 85 another with a 42
4:55:01
79 90 56
4:55:09
61 let's say 30 i will create a new list of passing
4:55:15
grades equals again follow this formula for every grade in
4:55:24
grades check our condition if our grade is greater than or equal to 60 we will
4:55:32
return the current grade then let's print our list of
4:55:39
passing grades that will give us 85 79 90 and 61 all of these grades are
4:55:48
greater than or equal to 60 all right everybody so that is a list comprehension it's a concise way to
4:55:55
create lists in Python they're compact and easier to read than traditional loops remember for every value in your
4:56:03
iterable optionally you can check a condition you can write an expression to modify that value if you choose and
4:56:10
return something all right everybody so those are list comprehensions in
4:56:16
Python hey everybody so today I'm going to explain match case statements in Python if you're familiar with other
38.match-case statements
4:56:23
programming languages this is also known as a switch match case statements are alternatives to using many else if
4:56:30
statements we execute some code if a value matches
4:56:36
a case the benefits of using a match case statement is that they're cleaner and the syntax is more readable in this
4:56:43
sample program I have a function there is one parameter a day day will be a
4:56:48
number ideally a number 1 through 7 depending on this number we'll return a string corresponding to the day of the
4:56:55
week if day equals 1 then it is Sunday
4:57:02
two it is Monday all the way up to 7 where it will be Saturday i do have an
4:57:10
else clause if we pass in something that's not valid like
4:57:15
pizza pizza is not a day but it really should be not a valid day a cleaner and
4:57:21
more readable alternative is to use a match case statement instead of many else if statements here's how i'm going
4:57:29
to take my if and many else if statements and enclose them within a match
4:57:36
case match case the case is going to be the value we're examining the case will
4:57:43
be day colon we're going to examine our value
4:57:48
of day against matching cases we're going to replace if day
4:57:55
equals with the following just simply case so let's do that with each of these
4:58:12
statements if you have an else clause you're instead going to have a case of
4:58:18
underscore an underscore in a match case statement is a wild card we will perform
4:58:24
this case if there are no matching cases this case would function as the else
4:58:29
statement here's what we're working with now if I pass in one and return the day
4:58:34
of the week we would get Sunday 2 would be Monday 3 Tuesday
4:58:45
7 is Saturday and then let's try that day of
4:58:50
pizza that is not a valid day a match case statement is an alternative to
4:58:56
using many else if statements i find this much easier to read than the many else if statements both would
4:59:02
technically function let's go over a second example we will create a function
4:59:07
of is weekend we have to pass in a day this
4:59:13
time our day is going to be a string such as Monday the value for each case instead
4:59:19
of a number is going to be a string if our day matches a case of
4:59:25
Sunday let's return how about a boolean of true we're checking to see if it's
4:59:32
the weekend if our day is equal to a case of Monday then we will return false
4:59:41
let's do this with the other days i'm going to fast forward the video
5:00:03
we will call the function of is weekend then pass in a day of the week such as
5:00:08
Monday so is Sunday the weekend that is
5:00:13
true monday that is false
5:00:20
saturday that is true and we do have a wild card case if there are no
5:00:25
matches is pizza a day of the weekend that is false there is a way we can
5:00:31
modify this match case too we tend to be repeating ourselves a lot the days Monday through Friday all return false
5:00:39
we're going to use the or logical operator which is represented with a vertical bar if the case of
5:00:48
Saturday or Sunday return true if the case is
5:00:54
Monday or Tuesday we can get rid of that
5:01:01
or Wednesday or
5:01:12
Thursday or
5:01:17
Friday then we will return false we can keep our wild card
5:01:23
case so is Saturday part of the weekend that is
5:01:29
true is Monday false
5:01:35
Sunday true Friday
5:01:41
false and pizza we have our wild card case that
5:01:47
gives us false all right everybody so those are match case statements they're similar to switches in other programming
5:01:53
languages they're an alternative to using many else if statements we execute some code if a value matches a case the
5:02:03
benefits is that the code is cleaner and the syntax is more readable and well everybody those are match case
5:02:09
statements in Python hello friends it's me again today
39.modules
5:02:15
I'm going to explain modules a module is just a Python file containing code you
5:02:20
want to include in your program you use the import keyword to include a module you can use built-in modules or create
5:02:27
your own sometimes it's useful to break up a large program into reusable separate files for a list of all the
5:02:33
modules found within the standard Python library you can use the help function pass in the word modules and then we
5:02:40
would need to print this here are many of the different
5:02:46
modules available to you a few you may recognize would be math string time one
5:02:52
of my favorite names of a module is the pickle module unfortunately it doesn't have anything to do with pickles it's
5:02:58
used for serialization to list all of the different variables and functions found within a module you can place that
5:03:04
name of the module within the help function for example with the math module here are a few different
5:03:10
variables we would have access to and a few different functions to include a module we would
5:03:16
type import the name of the module for example math i now have access to everything found within the math module
5:03:24
including those variables and functions to access those variables and functions I would normally type the name of the
5:03:30
module dot the name of the variable or function such as pi then let's print
5:03:35
this pi from the math module is 3.14 and
5:03:41
some change another way to import is to type import the name of the module as
5:03:48
you can give your module a nickname an alias whatever you think of such as M m
5:03:53
short for math we would no longer refer to this module as math we would refer to it as our alias
5:04:02
M using an alias would reduce some of the typing you have to use if you have a very long module name another way to
5:04:09
import is to use from the name of the module import something specific pi for
5:04:15
instance you would no longer need the module name from math import pi pi would be
5:04:23
included within our name space however I tend to not use from import as much just
5:04:28
because it's possible there could be name conflicts here's an example let's say from math import E e is an
5:04:35
exponential constant e is
5:04:40
2.71 what if I was to create a program where we have four variables named A B C
5:04:47
D a = 1 B = 2 C = 3 D= 4 then I'm going
5:04:53
to print E from the math module to the power of
5:04:59
A that would give me 2.71 then let's do this with B C and
5:05:06
D e to the power of B E to the power of C E to the power of D here are the
5:05:12
results let's say we have a different variable E e will be
5:05:18
five then I will print E to the power of E we have
5:05:24
imported E from the math module when we have declared all of these variables technically what we've done is we have
5:05:31
created another version of E we will end up using the second version rather than the version that we have imported from
5:05:37
the math module all my results are now different and it's possible you may not realize it i like to be more explicit
5:05:44
i'm going to import math if I'm using a variable or function from a module I
5:05:50
much prefer to prefix that variable name or function with the name of the module in which it's from math e to the power
5:05:57
of A to the power of B to the power of C to the power of D math E to the power of
5:06:05
our variable E and these results are to be expected now to create a module what we're going
5:06:12
to do is right click on our project folder go to new Python file think of a
5:06:18
module name maybe example then click Python file we now have two tabs main and
5:06:26
example declare whatever you would like within this module let's create our own variable pi pi=
5:06:34
3.14159 then a few functions let's create a function to square an argument that's passed in define square we will
5:06:42
accept an argument which we will name x then return x to the power of two let's
5:06:51
define a cube function we will accept one argument then return x to the^ of 3
5:06:59
maybe a circumference function define circumference we will accept a
5:07:05
radius then return 2 * * radius
5:07:11
then an area function to calculate the area of a circle we will accept a radius
5:07:17
as an argument then return pi * radius
5:07:22
to the power of 2 all right here is our example module
5:07:28
within our main Python program let's import the name of our module which we named example we now have access to
5:07:35
everything within this module i'm going to declare a variable result and set it to the name of my
5:07:44
module.py then I will print the result which is
5:07:50
3.14159 let's utilize the square function result equals example dosquare
5:07:58
let's square three which is 9 let's use the cube
5:08:06
function that would be 27
5:08:13
circumference that would give me 18.8 then
5:08:19
area that would be 28.2 that's how to create your own module it
5:08:25
can be useful at times to separate your program into individual files all right everybody in conclusion a module is just
5:08:32
a file containing code you want to include in your program you use import to include a module you can use built-in
5:08:38
modules or create your own if you do need a list of the modules available to you again you can use the help function
5:08:44
then pass in the word modules and well everybody that's how to get started with modules in Python
40.scope resolution
5:08:51
hey friends it's me again today I'm going to explain both variable scope and scope resolution variable scope is where
5:08:58
a variable is both visible and accessible with scope resolution when we're using a variable there is a
5:09:04
certain order known as the LEGB rule in which we locate that variable local
5:09:10
enclosed global built-in we'll get to this momentarily let's begin with variable scope i have two functions
5:09:17
function one function two within function one a equals 1 then we print a
5:09:23
within function two b equals 2 then we print b if I were to invoke these
5:09:28
functions let's invoke function one then function two we would print 1 then two variables
5:09:37
declared within a function have a local scope variable a is local to function
5:09:42
one variable b is local to function two within function one if I were to print B
5:09:48
and function two if I were to print A we would run into a name error name B is
5:09:54
not defined and the same thing would apply with A functions can't see inside of other functions imagine that we're
5:10:01
function one this is our house we can see everything that's going on inside of our house but function two is our
5:10:07
neighbor's house we can't see what's going on inside of our neighbor's house we have no idea what B is with function
5:10:14
2 function 2 has no idea what A is that's where variable scope comes in it's where a variable is visible and
5:10:21
accessible functions can't see inside of other functions but they can see inside of their own function that's why we
5:10:28
sometimes pass arguments to functions so that our functions are aware of them using this concept we could create
5:10:35
different versions of the same variable let's rename a to be X and B to be X as
5:10:40
well then I will print x we have two different versions of x a
5:10:48
local version of x found within function one and a local version of x found within function two whenever we utilize
5:10:54
a variable we will first look to see if there's any local instance of that variable if there isn't we would move to
5:11:01
the enclosed scope with an enclosed scope one example is when you have a function declared within another
5:11:08
function i'm going to place function two within function one this is allowed in
5:11:13
Python this is a more advanced concept we'll cover this more in the future so I'm going to eliminate this print
5:11:19
statement let's get rid of function two at the end of function one we will
5:11:25
invoke function two like I said it's pretty complex we won't be using this
5:11:30
until much later within function two if I was to print x we would use the local
5:11:36
version where x equals 2 if I was to eliminate this variable
5:11:42
declaration we would use the enclosed version instead where x equals 1 there's
5:11:47
an order of operations use any local variables first then enclosed variables
5:11:53
we're printing x within function 2 since x wasn't found within the local scope we
5:11:58
would use x within the enclosed scope but like I said that's a more advanced topic you should at least be aware of it
5:12:05
let's move on to the global scope global meaning outside of any functions i will
5:12:10
eliminate these variable declarations within function one we're printing X and within function two we're
5:12:17
also printing X i will declare a global version of X where X equals 3 x is
5:12:24
outside of any functions when I run this program we're printing three twice once
5:12:31
for function one and once for function two there's no longer a local version of X for both of these functions if there
5:12:38
were we would end up using these local versions instead function one prints one function two prints 2 if there's no
5:12:45
local version as well as no enclosed version we would move on to the global
5:12:50
version where X equals 3 last in our order is built in i think what we'll do
5:12:55
though is from math import E e is an exponential constant i'm going to print
5:13:02
what E is e is 2.71 e is built in i will create a
5:13:09
function to print E define function one all I'm doing is printing E then we
5:13:17
should invoke it invoke function one if I was to set E to be a different
5:13:23
value like three what we're doing technically is creating two different versions of E variables can share the
5:13:30
same name as long as they're within a different scope we have a built-in version of E and a global version of E
5:13:37
if I was to print E now it would print my global version because using the
5:13:42
leggb order we would first look for any local version of E then enclosed version
5:13:48
then global which we do have one of then lastly builtin all right everybody so in
5:13:54
conclusion variable scope is just where a variable is both visible and accessible python has a scope resolution
5:14:01
order levb if we're using a variable we will first look in the local scope for
5:14:06
that variable if we don't find that variable in the local scope we will move over to an enclosed scope then global
5:14:13
then built-in we will have more practice with this in the future and well everybody that is both variable scope
5:14:19
and scope resolution in Python hey everybody so today I got to talk about
41.if name == 'main'
5:14:24
this if statement if dunder name is equal to a string of dunder main when
5:14:30
you see this if statement it's usually followed by a call to a function named main or something similar a majority of
5:14:38
the driving code behind a program is usually found within some sort of main method when you see this if statement
5:14:44
basically speaking it means that this script can be imported or it can run standalone functions and classes in this
5:14:51
module can be reused in other programs without the main block of code running sometimes you would like the
5:14:57
functionality of a program without executing the main body of code a good example could be a library in a Python
5:15:04
library we would like to import some of the useful functions such as the math module but if we were to run that
5:15:10
library directly instead of importing it we could instead display a help page but
5:15:15
if we're importing that library we don't necessarily want to display that help page only if we're running it directly
5:15:21
in many Python scripts you'll see the statement of if done name is equal to main if we're not running this program
5:15:28
directly don't do it in this example we're going to delete our main Python script be sure to recreate it at the end
5:15:34
of this topic in case I forget to mention that we will create two new scripts go to file new Python
5:15:42
file script one file new Python
5:15:49
file script 2 we have to add new run configurations
5:15:55
for script one and script two so if you go to the top go to run edit
5:16:01
configurations we will add a new run configuration select Python select a new
5:16:07
script path to script one okay apply again we have to do this with script two
5:16:14
add Python select a script path of script 2
5:16:20
okay apply then okay using this drop-own menu we can select which run
5:16:27
configuration we would like would we like to run our main Python file but we have deleted it do we want to run script
5:16:34
one or script two for the time being we'll select script one within script
5:16:40
one if I was to print then call the dur function dur
5:16:46
meaning directory python has all of these built-in attributes if you're not familiar with object-oriented
5:16:52
programming for now think of an attribute as a variable dunder name is a
5:16:57
special type of variable dunder meaning double underscore if I was to print what's contained within dunder
5:17:05
name we would receive a string of dunder main that's why in a script you may see
5:17:11
the statement if dunder name is equal to a string of dunder
5:17:19
main if so then you usually call a function named main to start your program i'm going to undo that so let's
5:17:27
import script two from script two
5:17:33
import everything asterisk means everything within script two I will
5:17:40
print dunder name and we'll see what's within it again I'm running script one
5:17:49
within script 2 dunder name is equal to a string of script 2 the name of the
5:17:55
Python script however within script one dunder name is equal to a string of
5:18:02
dunder main this means I am running script one directly let's delete this
5:18:07
import then go to script 2 import script one from script one import asterisk
5:18:15
meaning all we're now going to change our run configuration from script one to script two we are running script two
5:18:23
directly now dunder name within script one is the name of the Python script
5:18:28
script one dunder name within script 2 is now dunder
5:18:35
main so by adding this if statement of dunder name is equal to dunder
5:18:43
main we can check to see which file is being run directly if dunder name equals
5:18:49
dunder main we will call a function of main to contain the main body of our
5:18:54
program but we need to define this function define
5:18:59
main our main function will contain the majority of our Python code anything
5:19:04
that's not already within a function so let's
5:19:10
print this is script one then we'll define another
5:19:17
function of favorite food we will have one parameter of
5:19:23
food let's print the following message i'll use an fstring your favorite food is add a
5:19:33
placeholder add our parameter of food within our main function let's call the
5:19:38
favorite food function pass in your favorite food as a string i'll type in
5:19:44
pizza then let's print the word goodbye we're going to run script
5:19:52
one run it here's the result from the top down all of our code
5:19:58
is within functions we skip over it because we're not calling it quite yet the first thing we do in this program is
5:20:04
check this if statement if dunder name is equal to dunder main are we running
5:20:10
this program directly which we are we're running script one if so call the main
5:20:15
method to start the program we print this is script one your favorite food is pizza goodbye now I'm going to go to
5:20:23
script two delete our print statement change the run configuration
5:20:28
to script two and run it nothing should happen that's good now if we were
5:20:34
missing this if statement of if dunder name is equal to main then we delete our
5:20:39
main function here's what would happen we're importing script one but we're running
5:20:45
script two this is script one your favorite food is pizza goodbye i don't
5:20:51
want this code to execute we're not running it directly that's why we have that if
5:20:57
statement if under name is equal to main i only want to run this code if we're
5:21:02
running it directly so what we'll do within script 2 now is define a
5:21:08
function of favorite drink there's one parameter of
5:21:15
drink i will print use an fring your favorite drink is I'll add a
5:21:24
placeholder we'll add our parameter of drink let's print the message this is script
5:21:33
two we will call from script one the favorite food function pass in your
5:21:40
favorite food this time I'll say sushi let's call our favorite drink
5:21:46
function favorite drink i'll pass in
5:21:51
coffee then we will print goodbye
5:21:57
okay we are running script two this is script two your favorite food is sushi your favorite drink is
5:22:03
coffee goodbye we're running script 2 but we're importing the functionality of the
5:22:10
favorite food function from script one sometimes from another Python script you want to borrow something but you don't
5:22:17
want to run the main body of code directly i just want to borrow this function from script one and that's it
5:22:23
script 2 can be run as a standalone program but I can't import it without this body of code running i can add that
5:22:30
if statement if dunder name is equal to a string of dunder
5:22:37
main if we're running this program directly execute this code so let's call
5:22:42
a function of main define main then place our main body of code
5:22:50
within it if I run script 2 we have the same
5:22:55
message so by adding this if statement of if name is equal to main this script
5:23:01
can be run as a standalone program or it can be imported a more practical example of this could be a Python library you
5:23:08
can import the library for functionality but if you run the library directly you
5:23:13
could instead display a help page it is good practice to include if dunder name equals dunder main it makes your code
5:23:20
more modular helps with readability leaves no global variables and avoid
5:23:26
unintended execution and well everybody that is the purpose of if dunder name
5:23:31
equals dunder main in Python hey what's going on everybody so in this video
42.banking program
5:23:36
we're going to create a very simple banking program using Python this is meant to be more of an exercise to get
5:23:42
us used to working with functions when creating a project I like to divide that project into smaller sections then
5:23:48
handle them one at a time so we'll do that by declaring all the functions we'll need first with a banking program
5:23:53
we'll need to show a user their balance we'll define a function to show
5:24:00
balance for the time being I'll write pass just as a placeholder we'll need to make a deposit
5:24:07
define deposit make a withdrawal
5:24:14
define withdraw near the end of this project we
5:24:19
will be creating a main function and placing the main body of our code within it we'll handle that near the end just
5:24:26
to contain everything we have our three functions with our banking program we'll need to show a balance make a deposit or
5:24:33
make a withdrawal what are some variables we'll need well we'll need a balance which I will set to be zero
5:24:40
initially i will also create a boolean of is running this will be true if at
5:24:46
any time we set is running to be false we'll exit the program so with the majority of our code
5:24:54
we'll place it within a while loop while is running you can check to see if this
5:24:59
is equal to true but since this is a boolean that's not necessary we will just say while is
5:25:06
running if is running becomes false we'll exit the while loop within our while loop we'll print some sort of
5:25:12
welcome message let's print banking
5:25:20
program then list some options let's print
5:25:26
one show balance
5:25:33
two
5:25:39
deposit three will be
5:25:46
withdraw four will be
5:25:52
exit afterwards we will set a choice variable to equal some user input
5:26:01
input enter your choice 1 through 4 we're encouraging a
5:26:07
user to type in a number 1 through 4 to select an option do they want to show their balance make a deposit make a
5:26:14
withdrawal or exit we'll add a few if and else if statements let's check to
5:26:20
see if the user's choice is equal to one and that is a
5:26:25
string of one our user input is a string data type unless we were to type cast it
5:26:30
to something else if our choice is equal to one we will call the function to show
5:26:37
balance else if our choice is equal to
5:26:43
two we will make a deposit by calling the deposit
5:26:49
function else if choice is equal to three we will call the withdraw
5:27:01
function else if choice is equal to four that means we would like to exit so we
5:27:08
need to exit this while loop we can do that by setting our variable of is running is this program running equal to
5:27:15
be false to exit if somebody types in some input that's not valid we can
5:27:20
handle that with an else statement else let's
5:27:26
print that is not a valid choice okay let's see what we're working
5:27:33
with currently to test everything we haven't written anything within these functions yet show balance deposit or
5:27:38
withdraw so we can type one two three and four to exit
5:27:47
processed finished with exit code zero so we can exit the program we just have to select option
5:27:53
four with this else statement this will execute if we type in something besides the numbers 1 through 4 because there's
5:28:00
no other options left so to test that enter your choice 1 through 4 uh I'm
5:28:06
just going to type the word poo that is not a valid choice so we know that the else
5:28:12
statement is working once we exit the while loop let's print a
5:28:19
message that says "Thank you have a nice
5:28:30
day." If I was to type four to exit we should exit the program thank you have a
5:28:36
nice day let's make that h capital now we'll work on our functions
5:28:41
beginning with show balance currently these two variables are global we don't need to pass them as a parameter to
5:28:48
these functions quite yet we will be enclosing all of this code within a main function we'll handle that later though
5:28:55
so with show balance all we're going to do is print i'll use an
5:29:00
fring your balance is add a dollar sign
5:29:06
or other unit of currency of your choosing add a placeholder our balance
5:29:12
variable and let's see what we have i will type one to show balance
5:29:20
your balance is $0 i'll display our balance with two decimal places after I will add a format
5:29:27
specifier after balance colon 2f will add two decimal places we covered format
5:29:34
specifiers in a previous topic so if I were to run this again type one
5:29:40
we show $0 and 0 we're displaying two floatingoint decimal
5:29:46
places now we need to make a deposit that will be the next function we will define a local variable
5:29:54
of amount equals accept some user input enter an amount to be
5:30:04
deposited again when we accept user input it's a
5:30:10
string we'll type cast it to a number a floatingoint number because we have to
5:30:15
include dollars and cents we'll add some checks though after accepting some user input if our amount
5:30:24
is greater than zero we don't want anybody to make a negative deposit
5:30:31
let's print that's not a valid
5:30:39
amount else we are going to return our amount so this function is
5:30:46
going to return something so within our else if
5:30:52
statement we will take our balance plus equals the deposit we're
5:30:59
being returned with this will add our deposit to our balance balance plus
5:31:04
equals deposit let's try it let's show our balance our balance is
5:31:13
$0 we'll make a deposit of $100 exactly
5:31:20
again we'll show our balance after making the deposit your balance is
5:31:26
$100 let's attempt to deposit negative money we'll select two to make a
5:31:31
deposit we'll deposit
5:31:36
42069 that's not a valid amount so we have a problem we have a
5:31:42
type error unsupported operand for float and non type so within this statement
5:31:50
within if within our deposit function we're not returning anything let's just return zero we have
5:31:57
to return something and within this if statement we didn't return anything previously we'll either return zero or
5:32:05
return a valid amount let's try this again let's make a deposit i will
5:32:12
attempt to deposit 42069 that's not a valid amount our program's
5:32:20
not crashing that's good now we'll attempt to make a valid deposit
5:32:27
$501 then show my balance your balance is $501 okay that is the deposit function
5:32:35
we'll work on the withdraw function next we will create a local variable of
5:32:43
amount accept some user input enter amount to
5:32:51
be withdrawn our user input is going to be
5:32:57
a string we will type cast it to be a floatingoint number we need to check to see if our
5:33:05
amount we're trying to withdraw is greater than our balance
5:33:10
users shouldn't be able to withdraw more money than what they have in their bank account if the amount is greater than
5:33:16
our balance that we have we will print
5:33:23
insufficient funds else if the amount somebody's
5:33:30
trying to withdraw is less than zero we will print a different message
5:33:39
amount must be greater than
5:33:45
zero else we will return our valid
5:33:50
amount so with our if and else if statements we do need to return something if we take one of these
5:33:56
routes we will return
5:34:02
zero we're not making any changes within our else if statement
5:34:08
where we select choice three we're going to take our balance minus equals the
5:34:15
withdraw amount let's test this banking program let's show our
5:34:23
balance our balance is zero we'll make a deposit of
5:34:29
$100 show my balance again your balance is $100 let's press three to withdraw money
5:34:37
enter amount to be withdrawn one cajillion dollar insufficient funds yeah no
5:34:45
kidding let's attempt to withdraw money again we shouldn't be able to select a
5:34:50
negative amount 42069 amount must be greater than
5:34:57
zero let's enter in a valid number this time I would like to withdraw
5:35:03
$49.99 that has appeared to work we'll show our balance again your balance is now
5:35:09
$501 then we can exit by pressing four to exit thank you and have a nice
5:35:16
day the last few changes I'm going to make is that I'm going to enclose all of this code our main portion of code
5:35:23
within a main function just to encapsulate all of our variables and help with readability
5:35:29
we will define a function of main take all of our code within the main body of
5:35:35
our program and place it within the function i'm just going to select all of it and indent it at the end of our
5:35:42
program we need to call a main function to run it if you're familiar with the
5:35:48
statement of if dunder name is equal to a string of dunder main that means this
5:35:57
program can be imported or run standalone it is good practice to include this if statement we discussed
5:36:03
this in the previous video if we're running this program directly execute the main function however our variables
5:36:11
of balance and is running they're now enclosed within this local scope these other functions have no idea what these
5:36:17
variables are of balance so we need to pass in our balance to those functions
5:36:22
of withdraw and show balance when we show our balance we have
5:36:29
to pass in our variable of balance same thing with withdraw then set up those
5:36:36
parameters within show balance we will have one parameter of balance the same
5:36:41
thing with withdraw the last thing I'm going to do is add a little bit of text decoration around my program just to
5:36:47
make it look nice so I will print a bunch of
5:36:53
asterisks it's not necessary but I think it'll look nice
5:37:05
let's add some text decoration before and after the title of banking program
5:37:10
also before our choice basically whenever we print
5:37:15
anything we'll add some text
5:37:23
decoration let's do that with show balance our
5:37:35
deposit and within
5:37:46
withdraw okay let's run this one last time
5:37:53
banking program let's show our balance your balance is $0 we'll make a
5:38:01
deposit $1001 show our balance again your
5:38:07
balance is $1001 we will withdraw money enter an
5:38:13
amount to be withdrawn $1,000 insufficient funds let's try that
5:38:18
again let's withdraw $50 show our balance again
5:38:24
$501 then press four to exit thank you and have a nice day all right everybody
5:38:30
that is a simple banking program you can write using Python hey everybody in today's video
43.slot machine
5:38:36
we're going to create a beginner's slot machine program using Python this project's meant for beginners so let's
5:38:42
get started when creating a project I like to break up that project into different sections then tackle them one
5:38:48
at a time so with the slot machine what are some of the different functions we'll need well we'll need to spin a row
5:38:55
we'll define a function to spin row as a placeholder i'll write pass we'll return
5:39:01
to this function later we need to display or print the
5:39:06
row print row
5:39:12
if somebody gets matching symbols on the slot machine we need to give them a payout we'll create a function to get
5:39:20
payout in this function we'll calculate what that payout is going to be but again we'll get to that later we'll
5:39:27
write the majority of our code within a main
5:39:33
function at the end of this program I will add the if statement of if dunder
5:39:38
name is equal to a string of dunder
5:39:43
main then we will call the main function which drives our code this program can
5:39:49
be imported or standalone it is good practice to have this if statement a majority of the code we're going to
5:39:54
write is going to be within our main function so within our main function let's declare the variables we'll need
5:40:00
throughout this program we will need a starting balance which I will just name balance we will start with 100 as in
5:40:09
$100 we'll need to display some sort of welcome message let's print something we
5:40:15
will print welcome to let's name our game Python
5:40:22
slots just for some flavor I'm going to add some text decoration just a bunch of asterisks
5:40:28
i think it'll look cool but you don't have to let's display our symbols we're going
5:40:34
to use symbols i'll add some emojis we'll
5:40:41
use emojis in this program in place of images if you're on Windows you can hold down the window key plus semicolon let's
5:40:48
add a cherry you typically see a lot of fruit in slot machines a
5:40:56
watermelon a lemon there's also a lot of bells for
5:41:04
some reason but we'll add those and a
5:41:10
star let me just align
5:41:19
everything let's do a test run welcome to Python slots
5:41:26
let me make one adjustment okay I'm happy with
5:41:32
that so after our welcome message we'll continue playing this game while our
5:41:38
balance is greater than zero while we still have money we can continue playing
5:41:44
we will print I'll use an fstring current
5:41:50
balance colon space i'll add a placeholder pick a unit of currency i'll pick American dollars then we will
5:41:58
display the user's balance we will prompt the user to enter in their bet
5:42:03
which we will assign to a variable of bet so
5:42:11
input place your bet amount let's do a test
5:42:18
run welcome to Python slots current balance $100 place your bet amount we
5:42:25
won't deduce the bed amount from the balance quite yet i just want to be sure that we can enter in something
5:42:31
$1 good $10 $100 what if somebody types in a word
5:42:38
like pizza we need to prevent that input and correct
5:42:45
it we'll check if take our bet use the is digit method is our bet a digit if
5:42:54
somebody types in a word like pizza we need to tell them that's not valid so this will return true if our bet is a
5:43:02
digit but we're going to use the not logical operator if our bet is not a
5:43:09
digit then do this we will
5:43:14
print please enter a valid
5:43:19
number followed by the continue keyword the continue keyword will skip the
5:43:25
current iteration of this loop and start from the beginning let's test
5:43:33
it place your bet amount pizza please enter a valid number we
5:43:39
have our current balance again place your bet amount i'll type in one okay we did not get that message of
5:43:46
please enter a valid number this bet of $1 is valid so if our bet is a digit we'll
5:43:54
convert it to be an integer using type casting because when you accept user input it's a string it has the string
5:44:01
data type let's reassign our bet type cast our bet as an integer
5:44:10
then we will check to see if our bet is greater than our balance people can't
5:44:15
bet money that they don't have if the bet is greater than the
5:44:21
current balance if bet is greater than balance we will print this message
5:44:27
instead insufficient funds then
5:44:36
continue if somebody tries to bet negative money or no money we'll add
5:44:42
this statement if bet is less than or equal to zero we will
5:44:50
print bet must be greater than zero and
5:44:56
continue if all these checks pass if our bet is
5:45:03
not a digit if our bet is greater than our balance or if our bet is greater
5:45:08
than zero we will take our original
5:45:14
balance minus equals our bet to subtract it let's do a test
5:45:21
run place your bet amount pizza please enter a valid number i will
5:45:28
bet one cajillion dollars insufficient funds yeah no kidding
5:45:36
0 bet must be greater than zero what about $1 our bet should be subtracted
5:45:43
from our balance let's try 10 we are now down to 89 let's bet
5:45:51
$90 insufficient funds 89 and that has appeared to
5:45:57
work once we subtract our bet from our balance we will call the function to
5:46:03
spin row this function is going to return a
5:46:09
list which we will assign to be row row will be a list using the spin row
5:46:16
function we have to generate three random symbols then return them within a list we'll work on the spin row function
5:46:23
next within our spin row function we will declare a list of
5:46:29
symbols add your symbols but these need to be
5:46:38
strings make sure they're all comma separated
5:46:54
there we go this is where list comprehensions can come in if you don't know what a list comprehension is here's
5:47:01
an alternative we will declare an empty list of results this is an empty list we
5:47:08
need a for loop to generate three random symbols we could say
5:47:13
for symbol in range three
5:47:20
this for loop will iterate three times during each iteration let's take our
5:47:25
empty list of results use the append method we will append a random
5:47:34
choice among our symbols so we need to import the random
5:47:42
module we'll do so at the top import random
5:47:48
we're telling the random module to pick a random choice from this list of
5:47:53
symbols then we will append them to our empty list of results after we escape
5:47:59
the for loop we will return our results
5:48:04
it's a list now a much better option is to use a list comprehension here's how
5:48:11
it's going to be a lot more concise we will return a list within the list we
5:48:17
will write a list comprehension for every let's say symbol in range
5:48:26
three there is no condition what do we want to return during each
5:48:32
iteration access the random module use the choice method then pass in our
5:48:40
symbols symbol isn't used in this example what you may see people do is
5:48:45
use an underscore as a placeholder basically what we're saying is for every
5:48:50
iteration in range three return a random symbol that's all we need for the spin
5:48:56
row function going back we have our list of row afterwards I am going to print it to
5:49:04
test it print row and we should have three random
5:49:10
symbols after making a bet all right it looks like it's
5:49:16
working we'll make a few changes though instead of printing our row I'm
5:49:23
going to print the word spinning I will add a new line character
5:49:31
just to give us some space like after this word of spinning then we will call the print row
5:49:40
function we'll pass in one argument our row that's returned to us after we spin
5:49:46
the row so going to our print row function we need to set up one parameter
5:49:52
our row that we receive it's going to be a list one easy way to print the elements of a list is that we can print
5:50:00
pick some sort of separator for each item in the list for example I'll just print a space with strings there are
5:50:06
built-in methods we will use the join method then pass in our list or other
5:50:12
iterable basically what we're saying using the join method we're going to take our iterable in this case our list
5:50:19
join each element by a space a space character here's the
5:50:25
result we have three symbols you could join them by a different character i'll
5:50:31
add a vertical bar enter your bet amount $1 now we have
5:50:36
a vertical bar between each of these symbols we could include more than one character i'll add a space before and
5:50:42
after this vertical bar just to space things out i think that looks a lot better and
5:50:50
you don't have to but I'm going to add some text decoration before and after i'll add a bunch of
5:50:59
asterisks let's see what we're working with not bad
5:51:07
so every time we make a bet we get a new set of symbols now what if all three symbols
5:51:14
match we need to calculate a payout and give it to the user cuz well they
5:51:20
won so after we print our row we will call the
5:51:25
get payout function but we will pass in our row it's a list and our bet how much
5:51:33
did we bet we will be returned with a payout which we will add to our balance
5:51:40
let's go to the get payout function we're sending two arguments to
5:51:47
our get payout function a row and a bet
5:51:52
we have to check to see if each element in our row is all the same is it all the same character we can do that with an if
5:51:59
statement if our row at index of zero that's going to be the first symbol is
5:52:06
equal to row at index one that's the second symbol is equal to
5:52:14
row at the second index and that's the third symbol if all three symbols match
5:52:20
we have to return the bet multiplied within our if statement we will add
5:52:25
another if statement i will check to see if our row at index
5:52:31
zero is equal to our first symbol of cherry be sure to place it within quotes
5:52:38
because it's a string now the reason I'm only checking if row at index zero is a cherry emoji
5:52:46
all these symbols are going to be the same if we're within this if statement all of these symbols are going to match
5:52:52
we only need to check one of them it could be zero one or two but I'll just add zero they're all going to be the
5:52:59
same regardless if somebody has all cherries we will return their bet times
5:53:06
three or some other amount you can make the payouts higher or lower else if row at index zero is equal
5:53:16
to a watermelon then we will return their bet
5:53:23
times four so watermelons are worth more than
5:53:29
cherries else if row at index zero is equal to a
5:53:37
lemon we will return their bet time
5:53:43
5 else if row at index zero is equal to
5:53:49
a bell let's give them time 10 return bet*
5:53:57
10
5:54:02
else if row at index zero is equal to a star that's worth the
5:54:10
most we will return their bet time 20
5:54:15
make sure we're not within our if statement anymore if all three symbols don't match within our list we don't
5:54:21
want to give the user anything they lost that spin we will return zero that's all
5:54:27
we need for the get payout function scrolling back down after receiving a
5:54:33
payout it's returned to us from this function we'll check to see if our
5:54:38
payout is greater than zero that means they want to spin i will
5:54:45
print i'll use an F string u1 I'll add a placeholder proceed this
5:54:52
with a unit of currency i'll use dollars will display the
5:54:58
payout else if they did not receive a payout that means they lost that spin we
5:55:04
will print sorry you lost this
5:55:11
round then take our balance this is our original balance
5:55:17
plus equals our payout in most cases the payout is going to be zero but if the
5:55:23
user wins something we will add that to the balance okay let's do a test
5:55:29
run i will bet $1 sorry you lost this round and my current balance is
5:55:35
99 let's bet again i'll just keep on doing this until I
5:55:42
win we're going to lose more times than what we win
5:55:52
okay see I got all bells it says you won $10 once somebody runs out of money we
5:55:58
want to stop them from playing or if they would like to exit we'll create a variable of play
5:56:05
again we will accept some user input do you want to spin again
5:56:17
we'll add y for yes slashn for
5:56:23
no if our variable of play again does not equal a character of capital y then
5:56:31
we will break to break out of this loop let's do a test run enter your bet
5:56:37
amount i'll just bet a dollar do you want to spin again if I type in anything besides a capital Y we will exit i will
5:56:44
type in no then we
5:56:49
exit enter your bet amount i'll bet a dollar if somebody were to type in a
5:56:55
lowercase Y that doesn't register we'll make it uppercase by following our input with the upper method to make it
5:57:02
uppercase place your bet a dollar hey I won i won $3 do you want to play again
5:57:08
i'll type in a lowercase Y yes I would like to play again but I did not hold
5:57:14
shift in order to make this a capital Y that will still register and our current
5:57:19
balance is $12 we're ahead currently place your bet amount i'll bet
5:57:25
$10 we lost this round i will press N because I don't want to play again then
5:57:32
we exit so at the end of our program I will print I'll use an
5:57:40
fstring game over your final balance is
5:57:47
I'll add a placeholder pick a unit of currency i'll pick dollars display our
5:57:52
balance then I'll just add some text decoration before and after to make it all look nice
5:58:03
okay let's play this one last time enter your bet amount i'll bet a dollar sorry you lost this round do you
5:58:10
want to spin again yes I do i will bet $5 you lost spin again yes I will bet
5:58:18
10 20 again i'll bet 20 i keep losing
5:58:28
i'm running out of money guys hey I won $10 though do you want to spin again no
5:58:34
game over your final balance is $13 that's why you shouldn't gamble you tend to lose more money than what you gain
5:58:41
all right everybody so that is a slot machine program you can write using Python hello everybody today I'm going
44.encryption program
5:58:47
to show you how we can write a substitution cipher encryption program basically speaking what we're going to
5:58:53
do is that we have a message to hide the message we can encrypt it by replacing
5:58:59
every instance of one character with another chosen at random using the same
5:59:04
key we can then decrypt the message when I was at my university I took an intro
5:59:09
to cyber security course i turned this program in as a final assignment and I did get an A on it i don't know maybe
5:59:16
it'll help you at the very least it's a good exercise all right let's get started everybody we will begin by
5:59:22
importing the random module as well as the string module let's create a string of
5:59:29
characters named chars whatever characters you would like to use for your encryption program list them here
5:59:36
as a string however this can be a lot to write i think a better solution would be
5:59:42
to import some constants from the string module i'm going to include some punctuation i will import the
5:59:48
punctuation constant of the string module how the heck do you spell punctuation okay that's right plus I
5:59:57
will add some digits string dot digits constant plus string
6:00:07
dot asy letters let's take a look at our character so far
6:00:17
we have one long string of characters what if I would like to include a space a white space well there
6:00:24
is a constant for that but that includes things like carriage return that's going
6:00:30
to warp our results let me show you just for a demonstration string dot
6:00:36
whitespace plus all the other stuff we have a carriage return and some
6:00:42
other characters i would like to avoid that so in place of importing the whites space constant from the string module
6:00:49
I'm going to add a space character that's good enough here are all the characters I
6:00:55
will be using this program feel free to add more or less this is all one long
6:01:01
string i'm going to turn the string into a list where each character is an
6:01:06
individual element to do that I'm going to take our string of chars reassign it
6:01:14
then type cast my string of characters as a list then let's print it again
6:01:20
print chars instead of one long string we have a list a list of all the characters
6:01:27
we'll need i am then going to create a key which we will shuffle eventually key
6:01:34
then to create a copy of a list you can type the original list dotcopy
6:01:40
method then I will print my key i'm going to place these lists
6:01:47
within an F string
6:01:59
chars then key let's see what we
6:02:05
have we have two identical lists one for the original characters and the other
6:02:11
for the key we're going to shuffle this
6:02:16
key random.shuffle shuffle pass in our list of
6:02:23
key look at that all of the characters are now shuffled in a random order what
6:02:28
we'll be doing when somebody types in some text to be encrypted we will replace every instance of one character
6:02:35
within that string let's say an O then replace it with another one every time
6:02:41
we run this program this key will be reshuffled let's ask for some user input
6:02:47
this part of our program we will do some encryption plain text is the original
6:02:54
message plain text equals we will accept some user
6:02:59
input enter a message to
6:03:05
encrypt cipher text is the name of the encrypted message that will be an empty
6:03:13
string okay let's say a user types in a message enter message to encrypt i like
6:03:20
pizza it's a very important message every instance of a character
6:03:25
within my plain text I will refer to the key and replace that letter with a
6:03:30
different one for example any Z's I have two Z's in this program will be replaced with let's
6:03:39
see capital B every time we run this program though it's going to shuffle the
6:03:44
key so it's not going to be consistent what we're going to be doing is iterating over every letter in our plain
6:03:50
text for every letter in plain text strings are
6:03:57
iterable find the index of every letter from our plain text within our list of
6:04:04
characters let's assign a variable index index
6:04:09
equals take our list of chars use the index method we are looking for that
6:04:16
letter whatever letter we're currently on then return an index then refer to our key get whatever
6:04:23
letter is at that same index so we will append that to our cipher text it's
6:04:29
currently an empty string cyper text plus
6:04:34
equals our key at the given
6:04:41
index our cipher text should be the encrypted message now let's print it out
6:04:47
print I'll use an fstring original
6:04:52
message let's print our plain text then our encrypted
6:05:04
message print our cipher text string let's take a look so far enter a
6:05:12
message to encrypt i like pizza then here's the new encrypted
6:05:19
message every instance of a character within my plain text was replaced with another so for example any Z's were
6:05:26
replaced with E i have two E's within this encrypted message if I were to run this program again it would likely be
6:05:32
different i like pizza and here's my new encrypted
6:05:38
message my Z's were replaced with semicolons this time for every ladder in
6:05:43
our plain text get the index of each letter then refer to the key add the new
6:05:48
character to our encrypted message it's probably best for us not to display the characters and the key so let's hide
6:05:56
those we will be reusing this key for decryption now to decrypt the message
6:06:02
let's copy this section of code paste it we are now
6:06:08
decryptting we will ask for some cipher text then reset our plain text
6:06:15
for every letter in our cipher text refer to our
6:06:22
key append a character to our plain text within our list chars at a given
6:06:31
index we will display our encrypted message followed by the original
6:06:37
message let's try it one last time enter a message to
6:06:42
encrypt i like tacos here's my original message then
6:06:49
the encrypted message if I were to decrypt the encrypted message it should
6:06:55
give me my original message i will type in these characters
6:07:00
exactly hit enter and here is my message decrypted i like
6:07:06
tacos all right everybody so that is a substitution cipher encryption program for beginners when I was at university I
6:07:13
did turn this program in for a final assignment for a cyber security class and I did get an A on it so maybe it'll
6:07:19
help you and well yeah that's an encryption program for beginners in
6:07:25
Python what's up everybody so in today's video we're going to create a game of Hangman using Python i thought that this
45.hangman game
6:07:33
would be a good mini project for us while learning to code it is important to create small projects as you go along
6:07:39
here's one that we can make together when creating a project I like to declare the various variables and data
6:07:44
structures I'll need first followed by the functions I'll need for this game we will need a set of words one of these
6:07:52
words is going to be chosen at random so let's create a few words i'll add some
6:07:58
fruit apple orange
6:08:04
banana coconut and one more pineapple
6:08:11
using the random module let's import that import random using the random module we will
6:08:18
pick one of these words at random we won't be able to see what it
6:08:23
is but we can guess what the word is one letter at a time once we reach six incorrect guesses we lose the game
6:08:31
before each guess we will display some ASI art which I will name as hangman art
6:08:38
this will be a dictionary a dictionary where each key value pair contains a tuple so this is a
6:08:48
dictionary of we'll have a key which will be a number and a tpple the key is
6:08:55
going to represent the incorrect number of guesses so we'll start at zero we will display a tpple which will contain
6:09:02
some asy art then let me just copy this for one incorrect guess we'll display
6:09:10
some different ASI art i'll just put each on a new line for
6:09:19
readability so we're going to go all the way up to six once we hit six incorrect guesses we
6:09:26
lose the game each key corresponds to the number
6:09:33
of incorrect guesses once we reach six we lose the game each tpple that
6:09:39
corresponds to the incorrect number of guesses we will display a certain image if you would like feel free to look in
6:09:45
the description of this video if you would like to copy this to save you some time each tpple will consist of three
6:09:51
rows three strings for no incorrect guesses where
6:09:57
incorrect guess is a zero we will display nothing we can't see our hangman
6:10:02
person for one incorrect guess we will display their
6:10:09
head for two incorrect guesses we will display their head and the main torso of
6:10:14
their body which will represent with a vertical bar let me copy this
6:10:21
one for three incorrect guesses we will display their left arm represented with
6:10:27
the forward slash with four incorrect guesses we will display their right arm however if you
6:10:35
use a backslash that's an escape sequence within a string you have to use double backslashes to literally print a
6:10:43
backslash so with five incorrect guesses we will display their left leg of the
6:10:50
person then once we reach six incorrect guesses we display the full person
6:10:55
that's when we lose the game when we see the entire person that's some asy art that we can use so let's test it just to
6:11:03
be sure that everything is working fine i will print my hangman
6:11:10
art at the key of zero to represent no incorrect
6:11:16
guesses okay so when we display this person we're going to have to use some sort of loop for every let's say line in hangman
6:11:27
art at index of zero for zero incorrect guesses i will print each
6:11:37
line with no incorrect guesses we don't display anything that's correct we can't see the person and
6:11:44
that's okay so with one incorrect guess display the
6:11:50
dictionary where the key is one that displays the person's
6:11:57
head two two would be the main torso of their body
6:12:03
three their left arm four their right arm five their left
6:12:12
leg and six their right leg once we see the entire person we lose the game so we
6:12:20
can delete these two lines of code we no longer need them we know that our dictionary is working i'm going to zoom
6:12:26
out a little bit following our dictionary we'll declare the various functions we'll need throughout this program we will define a function to
6:12:35
display man our hangman there will be one parameter wrong
6:12:43
guesses and then for the time being I'll write pass we'll fill in this function later when we display our man we need to
6:12:51
know the number of incorrect guesses to display the right
6:12:57
image we have a display man function and a
6:13:03
display hint function we will have a string of
6:13:10
hint then I'll write pass for now our hint is going to be a list a list of
6:13:17
underscore characters for each letter that we guess right we'll flip one of those underscores to be a letter if that
6:13:24
letter is correct i'll create a function of display
6:13:29
answer within this function we will display the correct answer either when we lose the game or win the game and I
6:13:38
will write pass we will create a function of main to contain the main
6:13:43
body of code of our program again I'll write pass for
6:13:48
now i'll add the following if statement if dunder name is equal to a string of
6:13:56
dunder main if we are running this file directly I would like to call the main
6:14:01
function to start the program all right let me zoom out this will be the main
6:14:07
skeletal structure of our program import the random module we have our set of words we'll be importing more
6:14:14
from a separate file near the end of this video we have a dictionary where the key is a number to represent the
6:14:20
number of incorrect guesses and a tpple to display some asy art we have four
6:14:25
functions display our man display the hint display the answer and the main function to contain the main body of
6:14:32
code all right let's work within our main function within our main function we
6:14:38
will create a variable of answer what is the correct answer that we have to guess
6:14:43
i will access the random module call the method of choice then pass in our set of
6:14:51
words one of these words will be chosen at random let's test that i will print our
6:14:58
answer just temporarily we should get a random word apple apple
6:15:06
pineapple apple i guess it really likes apple for some reason there we go we have orange we are choosing a word at
6:15:13
random we no longer need this print statement looks like everything is working fine now we'll display our
6:15:21
hint our hint is going to be a list of underscore characters i need the number
6:15:27
of underscore characters to equal the number of characters in one of these
6:15:32
words that is chosen at random so I could multiply my list by
6:15:40
the length using the length function of my answer so let's print our
6:15:47
hint to see what we're working with with my selected word we have how
6:15:54
many underscores 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 okay we
6:16:00
have a different word 1 2 3 4 5 that is probably apple it has five
6:16:07
characters all right so that's our hint it's a list of underscore characters
6:16:13
when we guess a letter if it's correct we'll fill in one of the underscores with that correct
6:16:19
character we need to keep track of the number of wrong guesses we'll create a variable of wrong guesses set that equal
6:16:27
to be zero when we start the game we're going to keep track of all of the incorrect guesses that we've made we
6:16:33
will create a set of guested letters for an empty set we'll call the
6:16:40
set function normally in Python you can't create an empty set with just a set of parenthesis we have to use the
6:16:46
set function then I will create a boolean variable of is running
6:16:52
set that to be true while our game is running continue playing once we lose or
6:16:58
win the game we will switch this to be false to exit the game we will keep this
6:17:04
as true when we initially run this program after we declare the variables we'll need within the main
6:17:10
function we'll create a loop a while loop while is running we don't need to
6:17:16
say while is running is equal to true we don't necessarily need to create that comparison we can just say while is
6:17:24
running while this is true continue doing some code so what would we like to
6:17:29
do let's call the function of display man but we have to pass in the wrong
6:17:35
number of guesses call our function of display man
6:17:41
pass in our variable of wrong guesses when we begin the game we would like to
6:17:46
display one of these images then we will display our hint then we'll
6:17:51
call the function to display our hint pass in our hint that was the list
6:17:59
of underscore characters to represent the answer we have to guess we will
6:18:04
create a variable of guess and accept some user input we'll prompt the user to enter a
6:18:12
letter just in case a user types in a character that's
6:18:17
uppercase let's add the lower method to make it lowerase so let's fill in our display
6:18:24
man function there's not a lot to write here when we call this function we need
6:18:30
to display one of these images based on the wrong number of guesses one of these keys
6:18:37
within the display man function we'll create a for loop for every line in my
6:18:45
hangman art this dictionary at the key of wrong guesses
6:18:52
this will be a number 0 through six depending on what this number is I
6:18:59
will print each line print each line of that tpple
6:19:06
let's see what we're working with we'll do a test run so we are displaying no person we
6:19:14
can't see them for testing purposes I'm going to change wrong guesses to be one
6:19:19
we're displaying their head two displays their body
6:19:25
three displays left arm four is their right
6:19:31
arm five their left leg and
6:19:37
six is their full body that's when we lose now you don't necessarily need to
6:19:43
do this but I'll add some text decoration before and after i'll add just a bunch of asterisks
6:19:50
before and after i think that looks better but you
6:19:57
do you let's be sure to set wrong guesses back to zero after we display our hangman we
6:20:03
have to display the hint what's the clue we're trying to solve so we will call our display hint function and pass in
6:20:11
our list of hint so within the display hint function let me zoom out i will print the
6:20:18
following between each character within our hint each underscore we will display
6:20:24
a space character strings have a built-in join
6:20:29
method we'll call that then pass in our hint for each character within our hint
6:20:36
join it by an empty space so now when we do a test
6:20:42
run we are displaying an underscore to represent each character each is separated with the
6:20:49
space while we're here we'll fill in the display answer function we just have to copy this line of code from display hint
6:20:57
replace hint with answer and that's all we need for the display answer function so let me test that real quick after
6:21:04
displaying our hint temporarily I will display our answer just to be sure that
6:21:09
it's working yep there's our hint and there's
6:21:15
our answer that we have to guess okay let's delete this line of code we don't want to display the answer i was just
6:21:22
testing it so the user is going to be able to type in a letter to guess such
6:21:27
as a for example once we guess a letter if that letter is found within the hint
6:21:34
if it's one of these characters we need to switch that underscore to be one of those characters so we'll write the
6:21:41
following if statement if our guess is in our
6:21:48
answer in is a membership operator if this letter is found within our string
6:21:53
of answer we're going to create a loop we will create a loop that will iterate once for each character within the
6:22:00
answer but we don't know the length of the answer because Python will choose it at random so let's say for every index
6:22:09
we can shorten this to i for I in range the length of my
6:22:19
answer let's say the word is apple the length of the word apple has five
6:22:24
characters this would return five for i in range five then we will iterate five
6:22:30
times we'll iterate this loop once for the number of characters within my answer we'll check during each iteration
6:22:39
if our answer at index of I during the first iteration that will be zero then
6:22:46
the second iteration it will be 1 then two so on and so forth strings are
6:22:52
iterable if our answer at index of i is equal to our guess if there's a match if
6:22:59
we guess the correct letter then we're going to take our hint
6:23:06
at that given index of I and set that equal to be our guess looks like this if
6:23:13
statement is outside of the while loop i'm just going to indent it by one somewhere within
6:23:18
it okay let's do a test run i'm going to guess the letter
6:23:25
A yes we have one A let's do something that's probably not in here
6:23:33
q okay so there were no matches we don't end up doing anything so what is this word
6:23:40
probably this should be the word orange so let's guess
6:23:46
O R N E G all right we know that it works
6:23:56
what if somebody types in some input that's not valid before checking if that guess is correct we'll do some input
6:24:03
validation what if the user types in a whole word like
6:24:08
pizza we want the user to only guess a single character not many
6:24:13
characters we'll add the following line if the length of our guess that we type
6:24:21
in does not equal one then I will print the following
6:24:26
message let's say invalid
6:24:32
input then we will use the keyword of continue to skip this
6:24:38
loop continue okay enter a letter i will type
6:24:44
the word pizza we get this message of invalid input we skip that loop's current
6:24:50
iteration i will guess A there are two A's i will type banana and again we get
6:24:57
invalid input we have to guess one letter at a time what if somebody types in a number like one we would like to
6:25:05
prevent that so within this if statement I would
6:25:12
like to execute this code if our guess is not an alphabetical character i can
6:25:18
add the following or not take our guess dot use
6:25:25
the is alpha method if our guess is an alphabetical character this returns true
6:25:34
if it's not an alphabetical character it's false so we are checking if this is
6:25:39
not an alphabetical character we execute this code let's try this again i will
6:25:45
type in one invalid input
6:25:52
42069 invalid input let's say we guessed the letter A
6:25:57
what if we type in a letter we have already guessed i will guess A again if they already guessed a letter I
6:26:04
don't want that to count we'll skip the current loop iteration i'll add another if
6:26:11
statement if our guess is
6:26:16
in our set of guess letters then I will print the
6:26:24
following i'll use an F string our guess
6:26:31
is already guessed oh one thing I'm forgetting once
6:26:39
we check that our guess is not within our guess characters we'll take our guess letters this is a set add the
6:26:48
guess we're keeping track of the letters we have already
6:26:53
guessed so I will type let's guess A we have one A if I were to guess A again we
6:27:00
get that message of A is already guessed and then be sure to add continue
6:27:07
to skip the current loop iteration all right now going down to this if statement if guess is in our
6:27:15
answer if we guess a character that's incorrect we will take our variable of
6:27:22
wrong guesses incremented by one wrong guesses plus equals 1 let's do a test
6:27:30
run i will guess A there is an A what about Q there is no Q
6:27:38
we display our dictionary where the key is one we display that ASKI art r is there an R yes there is an
6:27:47
R this is probably orange i would like to be sure we
6:27:54
display the entire person i will guess some wrong characters
6:28:02
we know that that works now we need a win condition if we guess all of the correct characters and display the
6:28:08
entire word we'll work on that next if there are no underscore
6:28:15
characters not in our hint this will be true if there are no
6:28:22
underscore characters in our hint if underscores not in
6:28:28
hint we'll call our function of display man pass in the wrong number of
6:28:35
guesses call the function of display answer pass in our
6:28:44
answer we will print the text of you win then set our
6:28:51
boolean variable of is running equal to be
6:28:56
false let's win this time i already know that this word is probably
6:29:03
pineapple let's guess something
6:29:11
incorrect there we go we have two wrong guesses but we have correctly guessed
6:29:16
the word pineapple you win and we exit the program what if we lose i'll add the
6:29:23
following if statement else if our variable of wrong
6:29:29
guesses is greater than or equal so the length of our hangman art is a total of
6:29:37
seven there's seven total keys but once we hit six we lose the
6:29:47
game with this else if statement if the length of our hangman
6:29:53
art the length of our hangman art is going to be seven so we are going to subtract one for six for a total of
6:30:02
six once our wrong guesses is greater than or equal to six that means we lose
6:30:08
the game we will call the display man function pass in the wrong number of
6:30:14
guesses display what the correct answer should have been display answer pass in
6:30:20
our answer we will print you
6:30:27
lose then take our boolean variable of is running set that to be
6:30:35
false i'll guess incorrect letters
6:30:44
there the word was coconut we have six incorrect guesses we display the entire hangman the correct answer was coconut
6:30:51
you lose if you would like to import a larger variety of words we could create
6:30:57
a separate Python file for that so within our project folder we will create a new Python file i will name this
6:31:04
Python file words list this will be a Python
6:31:11
file let's take our set of words cut it i'll add a note that these are words
6:31:20
for hangman game words will be a set i recommend
6:31:27
looking online for a very large set of words that we can use then just copy and paste them within here while browsing
6:31:34
online I found an extensive list of animals that I can use so here are all the possible words for
6:31:41
my game so from my main Python file I have to import this module of words
6:31:50
list from the module of words list import
6:31:57
words and now I have a greater variety of words I can use let's run this one last time this word has four letters
6:32:05
i'll guess the vowels there's an A no e
6:32:11
i O there is an O is it
6:32:16
goat nope t R
6:32:23
bore all right the word was boar you win all right everybody so that is a game of
6:32:29
hangman that we can create using Python hey everybody so we have finally
46.python object oriented programming
6:32:34
made it to Python objectoriented programming this is a very important topic in Python an object is a bundle of
6:32:43
related attributes and methods attributes are similar to variables to describe what the object has so look
6:32:50
around you right now you are surrounded by different real world objects next to me I have a phone a cup and a book each
6:32:58
of these objects can have different attributes to represent it for example an attribute of the phone next to me
6:33:05
could be version number i could set that to be 13 is on could be another attribute is the phone powered on or not
6:33:12
that could be true or false or even a price i have a cup next to me what
6:33:17
liquid is within the cup in this case coffee what's the temperature of the cup is the cup empty is empty or even a book
6:33:26
what's the title of the book that could be a string how many pages does the book have pages could be another attribute
6:33:33
now objects also have the capability to do things they have methods which are
6:33:39
functions that belong to an object people mix up functions and methods all
6:33:44
the time they're technically different even when teaching I tend to make that mistake calling a method a function and
6:33:50
a function a method usually people know what you're referring to though a method is a function that belongs within an
6:33:56
object what are some actions these objects can perform with a phone you can
6:34:02
make a call or receive a call turn the phone on or turn the phone off those
6:34:07
could all be functions with a cup you could fill the cup drink from the cup or
6:34:12
empty the cup with a book you can open the book read the book and close the
6:34:17
book an object is a bundle of related attributes and methods they can
6:34:23
represent real world items to create many objects we'll need to utilize a
6:34:29
class a class is a type of blueprint used to design the structure and layout
6:34:35
of an object we need to design what our objects have their attributes and what
6:34:41
they can do their methods we will create a class of car we will create some car
6:34:47
objects class car to construct a car object we need a
6:34:54
special type of method called a constructor it works similarly to a function we will define a function of
6:35:03
double underscore init meaning initialize double underscore again and
6:35:09
then follow this with a set of parenthesis this is our constructor method we need this method in order to
6:35:15
construct objects it's a dunder method dunder meaning double underscore that's
6:35:20
a future topic i don't want you to be overloaded with information right now all you need to know is that we need
6:35:26
this method in order to create objects this method behaves similar to a function we need to set up the
6:35:33
parameters self is already provided to us self means this object we're creating
6:35:39
right now this car so what are some attributes that a car should have a
6:35:45
model that could be a string like a BMW a year that could be a number a
6:35:54
color let's add a boolean of for sale is the car for sale or not that's true or
6:36:02
false to assign these attributes we're going to access self self dot the name
6:36:09
of the attribute self domodel equals the model we
6:36:15
receive these are parameters when we receive the name of a model we will
6:36:20
assign it to this object let's do this with year self doyear equals year self
6:36:29
doc color equals color self for sale equals for sale this
6:36:38
is an example of a few attributes that a car might have a model year color and if
6:36:43
it's for sale or not represented by a boolean now to construct a car object we need a unique name for this car let's
6:36:51
just say car 1 car 1 equals take the name of the class add a set of
6:36:58
parenthesis to invoke the constructor we're going to do this almost exactly like a function we have parameter set up
6:37:06
we need to send a matching number of arguments self is provided to us behind the scenes automatically we need a model
6:37:14
year color and if it's for sale or not so pick a car of your choosing i'll pick
6:37:20
my favorite car the model will be a Mustang for the year I'll go with the
6:37:26
recent year of 2024 a color I'll pick red is the car
6:37:32
for sale i like this car so no I will set that to be false make sure false is
6:37:38
capitalized let's see what happens if I attempt to print our car object of car
6:37:46
1 what we're given is the memory address of this car object where it's located
6:37:53
but I would like one of the attributes located at this memory address instead
6:37:58
of printing the object itself we're going to access one of the attributes found within this car we will follow the
6:38:05
name of the car with a dot this dot it's known as the attribute access operator i
6:38:12
would like the model of car 1 that would give me
6:38:18
Mustang let's access the year take the name of the car car 1 dot the year
6:38:26
2024 followed by the color car 1 dot
6:38:32
color red car 1 is it for sale we'll print
6:38:40
that that is false now let's create a second car
6:38:45
we're going to reuse this class to create a second car we will create car 2
6:38:51
equals car we'll pass in some different arguments a Corvette the year will be
6:38:58
2025 the color will be blue is this car for sale let's say that is
6:39:05
true instead of accessing car 1's attributes let's access car 2's
6:39:11
attributes that would give us a Corvette the year is 2025 the color is blue for
6:39:18
sale is set to true or even a third car car 3 equals a new car we will pass in a
6:39:28
string of charger the year 2026 the color will be yellow is this
6:39:35
car for sale let's say that is true as well then I will print car 3's
6:39:41
attributes the model is Charger the year is 2026
6:39:48
the color is yellow for sale is set to true with classes they can take up a lot
6:39:55
of space for better organization you can place them within a new Python file so
6:40:00
let's cut our class and we will create a new Python
6:40:06
file within our project folder file new Python file the name of this Python file
6:40:13
is going to be all lowercase car then we will paste the class that we
6:40:21
cut originally class car which has a capital
6:40:26
C so from our main Python file we're going to import our car file our car
6:40:33
module from the name of the module car import the name of the class car then
6:40:39
when I run this program nothing should change we should still have access to all of our car
6:40:47
objects you could either keep your classes within your main Python file or import them if you would like to
6:40:53
organize things let's talk about methods methods are actions that are objects can
6:40:59
perform within our class we will define a method of drive self is going to be
6:41:06
provided to us when we invoke the drive function let's print you drive the car what other
6:41:15
things can cars do let's stop we will
6:41:23
print you stop the
6:41:28
car let's take car one access the drive method
6:41:35
you drive the car car 2 also has a drive method you drive the car same thing with
6:41:41
car 3 you drive the car let's access the stop
6:41:47
method car one stop car
6:41:54
2 and car 3.top these methods are identical for
6:42:00
each car object instead of printing the word car let's insert the model of the
6:42:06
car I will convert these print statements to fstrings instead of the word car let's
6:42:13
add a placeholder let's add self dot model self is referring to the object
6:42:21
we're currently working with use the attribute access operator followed by
6:42:26
the name of the attribute let's also do this with the stop method
6:42:32
self do let's take car one use the drive
6:42:40
method you drive the Mustang car one
6:42:47
stop you drive the Mustang you stop the Mustang let's do this with car
6:42:52
two you drive the Corvette you stop the Corvette car
6:42:58
three you drive the Charger you stop the charger now within our F strings let's
6:43:04
also insert Let's insert the color i'll add a placeholder self dot
6:43:12
color do this with stop as well self dot
6:43:20
color you drive the yellow Charger you stop the yellow Charger car one you
6:43:27
drive the red Mustang you stop the red Mustang car two you drive the blue
6:43:32
Corvette you stop the blue Corvette let's add one last method let's create a method to describe
6:43:40
our car we'll print the details of the car let's print I'll use an
6:43:47
fring add three placeholders let's print self
6:43:55
dotyear followed by self dot color then self do
6:44:03
model we'll take car 1 use the describe method that we
6:44:08
created describe car 1 car 1 is a 2024
6:44:14
red Mustang describe car 2 car 2 is a 2025 blue Corvette car 3 is a 2026
6:44:24
yellow Charger all right everybody so those are objects in Python an object is
6:44:30
a bundle of related attributes attributes are variables that an object
6:44:35
has and methods methods are functions that belong to an object they define
6:44:42
what this object can do and well everybody that is a summary of object-oriented programming using Python
47.class variables
6:44:50
hey everybody today I got to talk about class variables in Python class variables are shared among all instances
6:44:58
meaning objects created from a class instance variables are defined inside of
6:45:03
the constructor class variables are defined outside of the constructor with
6:45:08
class variables they allow you to share data among all objects created from the
6:45:13
class with instance variables each object has their own version with a
6:45:18
class variable all those objects share one variable here's an example we will
6:45:24
create a class of student we also need a constructor when
6:45:30
we create a student object this constructor is automatically going to be called but we need to pass in some
6:45:36
arguments we are provided with self self refers to the object we're currently
6:45:42
working with we will set up a name parameter and an age parameter we will
6:45:47
assign self the object we're currently working with set the name attribute to
6:45:54
equal the data for the name that we receive from this parameter and self age
6:46:01
equals age let's construct two student objects we will have student one equals
6:46:08
then call the constructor for student so type the name of the class followed by a set of parenthesis to
6:46:15
invoke it this will automatically call the constructor but we have to pass in data for the name and the age for the
6:46:22
name let's pass in Spongebob because basically everybody in the world knows who Spongebob is i don't know how old
6:46:28
Spongebob is we'll say he's 30 we'll create another student object which we
6:46:34
will refer to as student two we will call the constructor of our student
6:46:39
class pass in data for the name and age student two will be Patrick patrick will
6:46:46
be 35 okay let's make sure this works let's print student one's name followed
6:46:56
by student one's age
6:47:01
and we should get Spongebob and his age is 30 let's print student 2's name and
6:47:07
student 2's age patrick patrick is 35 now we'll create a class variable class
6:47:14
variables are defined outside the constructor and they are shared among all objects created from that class each
6:47:22
object has their own name and age property these are instance variables
6:47:27
but class variables are defined outside the constructor each object will share
6:47:32
this one variable so if we're working with students let's say there is a class
6:47:39
variable of class year what is the graduating year of this
6:47:46
class 2024 now let's print student one's
6:47:52
graduating year print student one dot
6:47:59
class
6:48:04
year okay so Spongebob has a class year of 2024 that's when he's graduating
6:48:11
let's check student two patrick his age is 35 his graduating
6:48:19
class year is 2024 now with class variables you can access them through
6:48:26
any one object such as student one or student two it's good practice to access
6:48:31
a class variable by the name of the class rather than any object created from the class since we're accessing
6:48:38
class year we'll access this class variable by the name of the class of student make sure the S is
6:48:47
capital this helps with clarity and readability if I was looking at this print statement I can tell that class
6:48:54
here is a class variable because we're accessing it directly from the class and not any instance from this class without
6:49:02
looking at this class I can't tell if class year is an instance variable or a
6:49:08
class variable but if I access it via the class name it's more explicit so
6:49:13
it's good practice to access a class variable by the class name itself and not any one instance of this class
6:49:21
let's create another class variable we'll create a class variable to keep track of how many students we
6:49:28
have created this class variable will be num students meaning number of students
6:49:35
equals zero so within our constructor we can write any code that we want this
6:49:40
code will always be executed when we instantiate an object i would like to
6:49:46
take our number of students and increment it by one each time we construct a new student object so
6:49:52
instead of using self self refers to the object we're currently working with if we're constructing student one just
6:49:59
imagine we're replacing self with student one or student two if we were
6:50:04
constructing student two if we're going to be modifying a class variable in
6:50:09
place of self we'll use the name of the class student access our class of
6:50:15
student get the class variable of number of students then I will increment it by
6:50:21
one plus equals 1 we are constructing two student
6:50:28
objects i will print access our class of
6:50:33
student get the number of students and print it we're constructing two student
6:50:39
objects if I print the number of students that we have it should be two
6:50:44
then just to be sure that this is working let's construct a third student object student three equals student this
6:50:53
student will have a name of Squidward squidward's age will be
6:50:59
55 now we have three students and for good measure let's
6:51:04
construct one more student 4 equals we will create a new
6:51:11
student with a name of Sandy sy's age will be
6:51:16
27 the number of students is now four just as an
6:51:22
exercise using an fstring let's print the student classes class year as well
6:51:28
as the number of students i will print use an F string my
6:51:36
graduating class of let's add a placeholder access the class of
6:51:44
student then access the class year my graduating class of
6:51:52
2024 has then we need the number of students we'll add a placeholder access the class of
6:51:59
student access the number of students has
6:52:04
blank students let's see if this works my
6:52:10
graduating class of 2024 has four students now if I were to change 2024 to
6:52:17
2025 my graduating class of 2025 has four
6:52:22
students let's print the name of each student these are instance variables
6:52:28
student one name then we need student two three and
6:52:38
four my graduating class of 2025 has four students spongebob Patrick
6:52:44
Squidward Sandy all right everybody so those are class variables class
6:52:49
variables are shared among all instances of a class they are defined outside of
6:52:55
the constructor the benefit is that they allow you to share data among all objects created from that class and well
6:53:02
everybody those are class variables in Python what is going on everybody so
48.inheritance 👨‍👦‍
6:53:08
today I got to talk about inheritance in Python inheritance allows a class to
6:53:13
inherit the attributes and methods from another class much like how a child in
6:53:18
real life can inherit traits from a parent by having a class inherit attributes and methods from another
6:53:24
class this helps with code reusability and extensibility in this example we're
6:53:29
going to create an animal class the dog cat and mouse class will inherit attributes and methods from the animal
6:53:36
class we will create a class of animal then I will define the
6:53:45
constructor when we construct an animal object let's pass in a name it's not
6:53:51
required but it might be good for this example we will assign the attribute of
6:53:56
name equal to the name we receive let's also add an attribute of
6:54:02
is alive whenever we create an animal we will set their is alive attribute to be
6:54:08
true and that is a capital T all animals can eat define eat we will
6:54:16
print using an string add a placeholder self.name the name of this animal is
6:54:25
eating all animals should be able to sleep define
6:54:31
sleep print i'll use an fstring insert
6:54:37
self.name is sleeping and that is all we need for the animal class let's define
6:54:44
class dog for a child class to inherit the attributes and methods from another
6:54:50
class after the class name that's going to inherit we need to add an inheritance
6:54:56
list with a set of parenthesis then list the name of the class we're inheriting from the parent the dog class is going
6:55:03
to inherit all of the attributes and methods of its parent animal
6:55:09
for the time being as a placeholder I'll add pass just to demonstrate this class
6:55:15
cat is also going to inherit from
6:55:20
animal and class mouse will also inherit from
6:55:27
animal okay I will collapse this for now we'll create a dog object dog equals dog
6:55:34
then pass in a name for this dog because we have one parameter set up of name this dog will be
6:55:42
named Scooby as in Scooby-Doo cat equals call the cat
6:55:50
constructor this cat will be named Garfield and
6:55:56
mouse mouse equals mouse our mouse will have a name of
6:56:02
Mickey even though there's nothing within this dog cat or mouse class we
6:56:07
should still have these attributes and these methods if you inherit the animal class you should have a name attribute
6:56:14
and is alive attribute set to true you can eat and you can sleep let's print
6:56:20
our dog's name dog.name
6:56:27
scooby print dog is
6:56:33
alive our dog is alive that is true let's have our dog object use the
6:56:39
eat method scooby is eating and sleep dog
6:56:46
sleep scooby is sleeping let's replace dog with cat
6:56:55
the name of the cat is Garfield garfield is alive garfield is eating garfield is sleeping and
6:57:02
mouse replace any instance of cat with mouse our mouse's name is Mickey mickey
6:57:08
is alive mickey is eating mickey is sleeping even though these children classes are empty we're still inheriting
6:57:16
these attributes and methods from its parent of animal this is convenient because you don't need to copy and paste
6:57:22
these attributes and methods for every single class for example if I were to copy these attributes and methods and
6:57:29
paste them well we have a lot more code to
6:57:34
write and as a consequence if I need to make a change to one of these methods I would have to do that to every single
6:57:41
instance of this method for example let's replace is sleeping with is asleep
6:57:47
well now I need to find every single sleep method and change it
6:57:56
manually it's not too bad if you only have a few classes but imagine if you have hundreds of classes that's going to
6:58:02
take a lot of work it's a lot easier to write the code once and then reuse it
6:58:07
and I only need to make that change in one place rather than make that change many times so let's change is sleeping
6:58:14
to is asleep and see if that works again mickey is
6:58:21
asleep let's replace mouse with dog scooby is asleep not only that but
6:58:30
with children classes they can have their own attributes and methods that are different from one
6:58:35
another so dogs have all these attributes and methods and they can speak
6:58:41
let's create a speak method and I will print a unique message for dogs woof
6:58:48
cats will also have a speak method but it's going to be different cats will
6:58:57
meow then for our mouse class they will
6:59:04
squeak let's have our dog speak
6:59:11
woof let's have our cat speak meow and our
6:59:17
mouse squeak all right everybody so that's an introduction to inheritance inheritance
6:59:23
allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class much like in
6:59:28
real life a child can inherit traits from a parent these are also known as
6:59:34
sub and superasses which is a topic for another day inheritance helps with code
6:59:40
reusability and extensibility if all of these children classes inherit these attributes and methods from another
6:59:47
class we only need to write that code once and not copy it for every single class that needs it we can write and
6:59:54
change the code in one place for better reusability and extensibility and well everybody that is an introduction to
7:00:00
inheritance in Python hey everybody so today we got to talk about both multiple and multi-level
49.multiple inheritance
7:00:07
inheritance we'll begin with multiple inheritance that's when a child class inherits from more than one parent class
7:00:14
for example a class of C can inherit the traits from both class A and B in Python
7:00:21
you can have more than one parent multi-level inheritance we'll talk about near the end of this topic so in this
7:00:27
example we're going to create two parent classes prey i'll write pass for
7:00:34
now and
7:00:39
predator we'll create a class of rabbit a class of
7:00:48
hawk then class
7:00:54
fish rabbit hawk and fish are going to be children classes prey and predator
7:01:01
will be parents if one of these classes rabbit hawk or fish inherit from prey
7:01:06
they get the ability to flee we will define a method of flee all we'll do in
7:01:13
this example is print the following text this animal is fleeing if you're a
7:01:21
predator you get the method to hunt define hunt
7:01:27
we will print this animal is
7:01:34
hunting rabbits they will inherit from the prey class they're typically not predators except that one rabbit in
7:01:41
Montipython and the Holy Grail that's the exception rabbit will inherit the prey class then it gets access to a flea
7:01:49
method hawks are predators they will inherit the predator class now fish they
7:01:56
will hunt smaller fish and flee from bigger fish you can consider fish both
7:02:02
prey and predators so they will inherit both classes we will use multiple
7:02:08
inheritance they will inherit everything from the prey class and the predator class now let's see if this does in fact
7:02:15
work now we'll create a rabbit object rabbit equals rabbit there are no parameter setup we don't need to send
7:02:21
any arguments to the constructor hawk equals hawk and fish equals
7:02:29
fish so let's take our rabbit object and they should have a flea method
7:02:34
rabbit.flea method this animal is fleeing but they do not have a hunt method because they're not
7:02:41
predators rabbit object has no attribute hunt hawks can
7:02:47
hunt they're predators they inherited that method this animal is hunting but
7:02:53
they can't flee they're not prey hawk object has no attribute flee fish can do
7:03:00
both they inherit from the prey class and the predator class
7:03:06
fish.fle this animal is fleeing fish.unt this animal is hunting children
7:03:14
classes can inherit from more than one parent which is what we did for fish they are both prey and predators whereas
7:03:22
in rabbits are just prey hawks are just predators if you need to inherit from more than one parent you just add that
7:03:29
additional class to the inheritance list with multi-level inheritance a
7:03:35
parent can inherit from another parent we will create a class of
7:03:41
animal and for now I'll write pass prey and predator are going to inherit from
7:03:47
the animal class so we need to add animal to each inheritance
7:03:53
list let's say if you're an animal you get a method to eat all animals will eat
7:04:02
print this animal is eating and you can
7:04:07
sleep define sleep print this animal is sleeping
7:04:18
so think of rabbit hawk and fish as children classes prey and predator are
7:04:25
those classes parents and animal is the grandparent prey and predator will
7:04:31
inherit everything that the animal class has rabbit hawk and fish will inherit
7:04:37
everything the prey and predator classes have so now our rabbit hawk and fish classes should have the ability to eat
7:04:44
and sleep and we'll test that rabbit this animal is eating
7:04:52
rabbit this animal is sleeping let's check out fish fish
7:04:58
fish this animal is eating fish this animal is
7:05:05
sleeping okay we're going to expand upon our example a little bit let me zoom out
7:05:11
each of our objects is going to have a name our rabbit will have a first name of bugs hawk will be Tony as in Tony
7:05:20
Hawk our fish will be Nemo within our classes we don't have
7:05:26
any constructor set up in which class should we assign the name
7:05:32
attribute let's do so within our animal class so we will define a
7:05:39
constructor to assign these attributes we will receive a
7:05:44
name we'll assign self.name equals name now with these
7:05:51
other classes if you're not assigning any attributes or if you don't need any other initialization logic you don't
7:05:57
need a constructor we'll implicitly use the constructor we inherit from the parent let's convert each of these print
7:06:04
statements to an fstring
7:06:10
replace animal with
7:06:21
self.name now let's have our rabbit use the eat
7:06:28
method oh we should get rid of
7:06:34
this there we go bugs is eating rabbit
7:06:41
bugs is sleeping rabbit flee bugs is fleeing let's check out our
7:06:47
hawk hawks don't have a flea method because they're predators not
7:06:53
prey let's eat tony is eating let's sleep tony is sleeping let's
7:07:02
hunt tony is hunting let's check our fish next our fish can eat nemo is
7:07:09
eating our fish can sleep nemo is sleeping they can
7:07:15
flee nemo is fleeing and hunt nemo is hunting okay everybody that
7:07:23
is both multiple and multi-level inheritance with multiple inheritance a
7:07:29
child can inherit from more than one parent class you just add each additional class to the inheritance list
7:07:36
with multi-level inheritance a child can inherit from a parent which inherits
7:07:42
from another parent class C can inherit from B where class B inherits from A
7:07:48
think of C as the child B is the parent and A as the grandparent c will have all
7:07:54
the attributes and methods even available within the grandparent class of A and well everybody that is both
7:08:01
multiple and multi-level inheritance in Python hey everybody so today I got to
50.super()
7:08:06
talk about the super function in Python super is a function it's used within a
7:08:12
child class to call methods from a parent class the child class is the
7:08:17
subclass the parent class is the superass hence why this function is named the super function using the super
7:08:24
function it allows you to extend the functionality of the inherited methods here's an example we'll create a few
7:08:31
shape objects we'll need to set up the classes though we'll have class
7:08:36
circle for the time being I'll just write pass we'll fill it in later class
7:08:44
square and class
7:08:49
triangle for each of these classes in order to instantiate objects we'll need a constructor we will define our
7:08:56
constructor our innit method when creating circles what sorts of
7:09:02
attributes should a circle have let's say a color what's the color of the
7:09:07
circle is it filled or not filt will be another attribute and a
7:09:14
radius then let's assign these self doc color equals the color
7:09:20
that we receive self do.filled equals
7:09:26
filled self do.t radius equals
7:09:31
radius let's do this with the square and triangle really I'll just copy our constructor and paste it squares don't
7:09:39
have a radius with a square the width and the height are the same let's replace radius with width we'll also
7:09:46
keep the color and field attributes self do width equals width
7:09:53
now with triangles again let's copy our constructor we'll need a width and a
7:10:01
height self.height equals height so with programming we try not to
7:10:08
repeat ourselves if we don't have to what do all of these classes have in common they all share the attributes of
7:10:15
color and filled the ways in which they are
7:10:20
different is that circle has a radius attribute square has a width triangle has a width and a height if we have to
7:10:27
make any changes to one of these attributes we would have to do so manually for example let's replace
7:10:33
filled with is filled now I need to look throughout my code for any instance of filled and replace it with is
7:10:40
filled it's a lot of work and I might make a mistake such as here and here it's
7:10:48
better to write your code once and try and reuse it so that's where inheritance and the super function can come in handy
7:10:54
we're going to take the attributes of color and is filled and place it within a parent class these children classes
7:11:00
will inherit those attributes so class what do they all have in common they're all shapes class
7:11:08
shape and for now I'll write pass circle is going to inherit from its parent of
7:11:14
shape that also applies with square and triangle we'll set up a constructor for
7:11:20
shape define init we will pass in the color and is
7:11:32
filled then we will assign these attributes self.c color equals
7:11:39
color self.isfilled equals is filled we don't
7:11:46
need to manually assign these attributes within each of these constructors for the children
7:11:52
instead what we have to do is within the constructor for each of these children classes we have to call the constructor
7:11:58
for the parent also known as the superass of shape so we will eliminate
7:12:04
these two lines of code use the super
7:12:09
function dot call the constructor of the parent that is the dunder init method
7:12:16
but we need to pass in the color that we receive and is filled this will be a
7:12:23
boolean and let's do this with the square class and the triangle class
7:12:31
we still need radius for the circle width for the square width and height for the triangle we're going to call the
7:12:37
super function to take care of whatever attributes all these types of shapes have in common such as color and is
7:12:44
filled now let's see if this works let's construct a few objects we will create a circle named
7:12:50
circle called a constructor for circle we have to pass in a color a boolean if
7:12:56
it's filled or not and a radius so for the color of the circle let's say
7:13:02
red is filled let's say that is true and a radius of five you could even use
7:13:09
keyword arguments for better readability although not necessary but for clarity let's say color equals
7:13:16
red is filled equals true radius equals
7:13:22
5 let's see if this works i will print our circles
7:13:32
color it is red print our colors is filled attribute
7:13:40
the circle is filled that is true and the radius print
7:13:46
circle dot radius the radius of the circle is five we could even convert
7:13:52
this to an string i'll add a
7:13:59
placeholder then add centimeters 5 cm let's construct a
7:14:07
square object square equals square we'll need a color is filled and
7:14:14
a width i'll just copy what we have and make a few changes replace radius with width the color will be blue is filled
7:14:24
will be false the width will be six we don't need a height because squares have
7:14:29
an even width and height if we ever need the height we can assume it's the same as the width in this case six let's
7:14:36
check out our square square.color square.filled
7:14:44
square.idth our square is blue it's not filled in the width is 6 cm
7:14:51
let's create a triangle object triangle equals
7:14:56
triangle pass in our arguments the color will be yellow is
7:15:02
filled will be true the width will be seven and the height will be
7:15:10
eight let's print our triangle's color is it filled its width and its
7:15:17
height our triangle is yellow it's filled in
7:15:25
the width is 7 cm the height is 8 cm so that's how you can use the super
7:15:31
function to reuse the constructor of a parent class we don't need to manually assign each of these attributes within
7:15:38
each of the children classes we can do that in just one place when we refer to super imagine that we're replacing this
7:15:45
with the parent class name such as shape that might be a good way to think
7:15:51
of it use the constructor of the parent class of shape and pass these arguments
7:15:58
in what you could do as well is extend the functionality of a method so within
7:16:03
our shape class let's create a method of describe
7:16:09
we will describe the attributes of this shape we will print use an fstring when we want to
7:16:17
describe our shape let's say it is at a placeholder self doc color what is the
7:16:24
color of this shape and is it filled or not and add a placeholder we'll use a
7:16:30
turnary operator print filled if self is filled is true else we
7:16:41
will print not filled each of these types of shapes
7:16:48
circle square and triangle will have access to a describe method let's attempt to use
7:16:55
it take our circle use the describe method that's inherited
7:17:01
it is red and filled square it is blue and not filled
7:17:08
triangle it is yellow and filled so then we also have method
7:17:13
overwriting what if we create a similar method of describe within circle square
7:17:19
and triangle let's do that define a describe
7:17:27
method within our circle let's calculate the area what's the area of the circle
7:17:33
i'll use an F string it is a circle
7:17:38
with an area of then we'll calculate the area given the
7:17:44
radius to calculate the area of a circle we can take pi I'll just say 3.14 just
7:17:50
to keep it simple times the radius squared self time self.raius
7:17:59
if I were to call the describe method will we use the parents version of describe or the
7:18:06
child so let's take our circle use the describe
7:18:11
method the result it is a circle with an area of 78.5 i should really add centime
7:18:19
squared after that cime squared this is called method
7:18:26
overwriting if a child shares a similar method with a parent you'll use the
7:18:31
child's version and not the parents this is method overriding if you would like to extend the functionality of a method
7:18:39
from a parent you can use the super function not only do I want to use the describe method of the child I would
7:18:46
also like to use the describe method of the parent so within this function we will use the super function access the
7:18:54
describe method of the parent what we're doing is extending the functionality of the describe
7:19:02
method it is a circle with an area of 78.5 cm squared the circle is red and
7:19:09
it's filled or you could change up the order
7:19:15
let's use the parent classes describe method and extend the functionality with our own print
7:19:21
statement it is read and filled it is a circle with an area of 78.5 cm squared
7:19:28
let's finish this with the square and triangle classes i'll copy what we have for the describe method within the
7:19:34
circle class but we'll make a different
7:19:39
calculation describe the square it is a square with an area of take self
7:19:46
dowidth times self.width the height and the width are
7:19:52
going to be the same if it's a square then describe our
7:20:00
triangle it is a triangle with an area of width time
7:20:06
height we have a height in this case divided by two we've already described our circle let's describe our
7:20:14
square it is a square with an area of 36 cm squared it is blue and not filled
7:20:20
let's describe our triangle it is a triangle with an area of 28.0 cm squared it is yellow and
7:20:29
filled all right everybody that is the super function it's used in a child class to call the methods from a parent
7:20:36
class also known as the superass it allows you to extend the functionality
7:20:41
of the inherited methods within a child class you could use it within a constructor to assign any attributes
7:20:48
that all of its siblings have in common such as color or if that shape is filled
7:20:54
when used within any other method you can extend the functionality of that method not only are we printing this
7:21:01
message from the parent we're tacking on another print statement before that and well everybody that is the super
7:21:07
function in Python what is going on everybody so today I got to talk about
51.polymorphism
7:21:13
polymorphism in Python polymorphism is a programming concept it's a Greek word
7:21:18
that means to have many forms or faces poly means many morph means form in
7:21:24
programming an object can take one of many forms there's two ways to achieve polymorphism one is through inheritance
7:21:31
an object could be treated of the same type as a parent class there's also duct
7:21:37
typing which we'll talk about in the next topic in this video we're more focused on inheritance what we'll do in
7:21:43
this video is create a class of shape we'll write pass as a placeholder we
7:21:49
will create a class of circle which will inherit from shape again writing
7:21:56
pass class square inherits from
7:22:02
shape class triangle which inherits from
7:22:10
shape if I was to create a circle object circle equals
7:22:15
circle our circle identifies as a circle and since our circle class inherits from
7:22:21
the shape class our circle is also considered a shape it has two forms it's
7:22:26
a circle and it's a shape but our circle isn't a square or a triangle that could
7:22:31
also apply to our square class our square is a square our square
7:22:37
is also considered a shape but our square is not a circle or a triangle those are two possible forms for our
7:22:43
square it's a square and a shape so let's say we would like to create a list of shapes what do they all have in
7:22:50
common well they're all shapes a descriptive name for this list would be shapes equals an empty list i will
7:22:58
instantiate a circle object a square object and a triangle
7:23:06
object our circle is a circle and a shape our square is a square and a shape
7:23:12
our triangle is a triangle and a shape each of these objects has two forms or
7:23:18
two faces let's fill in some of these classes let's say that with our shape class we will define an area method
7:23:26
define area i'm going to turn this into an abstract method i'll just write pass
7:23:32
to work with abstract classes we need to import that from ABC import capital ABC as well as
7:23:42
abstract method preceding the area method I will add a decorator of
7:23:47
abstract method our circle square and triangle classes they're all considered shapes they inherit from this class we
7:23:55
need to define an area method for each since they're all considered a shape every shape has an area with our class
7:24:02
of circle let's define a constructor define
7:24:08
init we will pass in one argument a radius what is the radius of the circle
7:24:14
assign an attribute of radius equals the radius we receive let's do this with
7:24:20
square define innit one parameter the length of a side
7:24:28
self dot side equals side then
7:24:33
triangle define init we have two parameters base and
7:24:43
height self.base equals base
7:24:49
self.height equals height all right now let's finish defining these area methods for each
7:24:55
class we will
7:25:00
return 3.14 time
7:25:06
self.US to the power of 2 so given a radius that's how to
7:25:11
calculate the area of a circle then with our
7:25:16
square define area we will
7:25:22
return self do side to the power of
7:25:28
two then with our triangle define
7:25:35
area return self.base time self.height
7:25:42
height time 0.5 now we have to pass in some arguments for our circle we need a
7:25:49
radius i'll pick four for the square the length of a side will be five then our
7:25:55
triangle the base will be six the height will be seven we're going to write a
7:26:00
loop to iterate through our shapes for every shape in
7:26:05
shapes then we're going to print for every shape called the area
7:26:14
method and that would give me these numbers if you would like you can format
7:26:20
the output i'll just use an F
7:26:25
string i'll add centime squared
7:26:35
much better what if we were to create a class that's completely unrelated to
7:26:41
shapes i will create a class of
7:26:47
pizza i will define a constructor to construct a pizza object
7:26:53
we need a topping and a radius what is the radius of the pizza
7:27:01
self equals topping
7:27:07
self.raius equals radius within my list of shapes I'll add
7:27:12
a pizza object but I have to pass in a topping such as
7:27:19
pepperoni and what is the radius of the pizza let's say 15 cm so our pizza our
7:27:27
pizza class doesn't have an area method here's what happens when I run this we get an attribute error pizza
7:27:35
object has no attribute area our pizza object is considered a
7:27:40
pizza but it is not considered a shape it does not inherit from the shape class
7:27:46
at the top here you know what a pizza is circular it could be considered a circle
7:27:51
so how about this let's take the pizza class it will inherit from the circle
7:27:56
class and within our circle class we're already assigning the radius to the radius attribute so instead of doing
7:28:04
that here within the constructor for our pizza class let's call the super constructor super which refers to the
7:28:11
parent use its constructor then pass in the radius we
7:28:16
receive let's see if this works now that does here is the area of our
7:28:24
pizza our pizza is considered a pizza it inherits from the circle class so it's
7:28:29
also considered a circle and our circle class inherits from the shape class our
7:28:35
pizza has three forms our pizza is considered a pizza it's also considered a circle and it's also considered a
7:28:42
shape it would make sense for it to fit into this list of shapes because our pizza also identifies as a shape so
7:28:50
that's polymorphism everybody it's a Greek word meaning to have many forms or faces poly meaning many morph meaning
7:28:57
form in Python there's two ways to achieve polymorphism one through inheritance an object could be treated
7:29:04
of the same type as a parent and there's also duct typing which we'll discuss more in the next topic stay tuned for
7:29:10
that and well everybody that's polymorphism in Python hey everybody so today I got to
52.duck typing
7:29:18
talk about duct typing in Python duct typing is another way to achieve polymorphism besides using inheritance
7:29:25
objects can be treated as if they're a different type as long as they meet the minimum necessary attributes and methods
7:29:30
required of them it follows this adage if it looks like a duck and quacks like
7:29:36
a duck it must be a duck as long as an object resembles another it could also
7:29:42
be treated of that type so in this example let's create a class of animal
7:29:48
we will have a class attribute of alive if you're an animal you will have an
7:29:54
attribute of alive you're a living creature let's create a class of dog the
7:30:00
dog class will inherit from the animal class they will inherit the alive attribute let's also define a speak
7:30:08
method if you're a dog you gain the ability to speak we will
7:30:14
print woof then we'll create a cat class class cat inherits from animal for
7:30:23
the speak method we will print meow let's create a list of animals what
7:30:29
do these two classes have in common they both can be considered animals let's create a list of
7:30:36
animals we will construct a dog object and a cat object
7:30:42
if I was to write a for loop for every animal in my list of
7:30:48
animals have each animal use its speak method which will result in the dog
7:30:56
going woof the cat going meow they're both speaking what if we add a class that has
7:31:02
nothing to do with animals like class car
7:31:08
cars will have a horn method that's how they speak when you honk the horn you will
7:31:16
print honk within my list of animals let's
7:31:22
create a car object it really doesn't belong in here but let's see what
7:31:28
happens we have an attribute error car object has no attribute
7:31:34
speak our car object doesn't have the minimum necessary attributes and
7:31:40
methods when iterating through this list of animals we're calling each animal speak method which our car object
7:31:47
doesn't have but it does have a horn method so what if we rename our horn
7:31:53
method as speak maybe it's an AI car or
7:31:58
something well this would work the dog goes woof the cat goes meow the car goes
7:32:05
honk so our car object it quacks like a duck we could
7:32:11
consider it a duck it has the minimum necessary methods to be considered an
7:32:17
animal animals inherit this alive attribute let's utilize that after the
7:32:23
animal speaks let's print their alive attribute print my animals alive
7:32:31
attribute my car object doesn't have that attribute we get an attribute error
7:32:37
car object has no attribute alive but if I was to add that
7:32:43
attribute alive equals false we have true for the dog it's
7:32:51
living true for the cat it's living but false for the car it's not living it's
7:32:56
not a living creature my car meets the minimum necessary requirements to be considered an animal
7:33:04
if I were to set this to be alive well then it would be a living car
7:33:10
kind of like the movie Cars so with Python duct typing is another way to
7:33:16
achieve polymorphism besides using inheritance as long as an object has the minimum necessary attributes and methods
7:33:23
you could treat it as a different type of object if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck it must be a duck and
7:33:30
well everybody that is duck typing in Python hey what's going on everybody
53.static methods
7:33:36
today I'm going to talk about static methods in Python a static method is a method that belongs to a class rather
7:33:44
than any object from that class any instance instance methods we're already
7:33:50
familiar with them they are methods that belong to individual objects created from that class they're best for
7:33:56
operations on instances of that class any objects whereas static methods
7:34:01
they're best for utility functions within a class that do not need access to class data i'll demonstrate the
7:34:08
differences between an instance method and a static method we'll begin by creating a class of
7:34:15
employee we'll need a constructor let's define that to create an employee object we'll
7:34:23
need a name and a job position we will assign
7:34:29
self.name equals name self.position equals
7:34:36
position we will create an instance method of get info we will return
7:34:42
employee info we will return an fstring where we
7:34:48
will display self.name name equals
7:34:57
self.position get info is an instance method each object that we create from
7:35:03
this class will have their own get info method to return the information on that object the object's name and the
7:35:10
object's position now we'll create a static method to create a static method we need
7:35:16
a decorator of static method static methods are best for general
7:35:23
utility functions within a class we'll define a method to check to see if a job
7:35:29
a position is valid which we will name is valid
7:35:35
position so static methods they don't have self as the first argument we're not working with any objects created
7:35:42
from this class to check to see if a position is valid we will pass in a job position which I will name as
7:35:51
position i will create a list of valid
7:35:57
positions let's assume that our company is the Krusty Krab what are some valid positions a manager is a valid position
7:36:06
a cashier a cook then let's say a janitor
7:36:14
then we will return we'll use a membership operator check if position that we
7:36:22
receive is in our list of valid
7:36:29
positions what we have done is that we have created a static method we don't need to rely on any objects to use this
7:36:36
method for example to use a static method we will
7:36:42
use the name of the class rather than any object that we create from this class such as
7:36:48
this we don't need to do that we type the class name followed by
7:36:55
the static method is valid
7:37:01
position then I did set this up to accept one argument let's check to see
7:37:06
if a cook is a valid position then I do need to print this
7:37:13
what is the output a cook is a valid position what
7:37:19
about a rocket scientist that would probably be Sy's job that is false a
7:37:27
rocket scientist is not a valid position at the Krusty Krab this is a static method it belongs
7:37:33
to the class not any object created from that class now let's create a few employee objects let's say employee 1
7:37:42
equals a new employee we have to pass in a name and a
7:37:47
job eugene will be the first name that's Mr krabs he will be a
7:37:54
manager employee 2 equals
7:38:00
employee Squidward will be a
7:38:06
cashier employee 3 equals
7:38:11
employee employee 3 will be Spongebob spongebob will be a
7:38:17
cook to call an instance method we have to access one of the instances of the
7:38:23
class in order to use it if I want to check the info on employee 1 I will access that object that
7:38:31
instance use the get info method then I need to print
7:38:38
it take employee one get the info eugene is the manager let's do this with
7:38:45
employee 2 and employee 3 eugene Mr krabs is the manager
7:38:53
squidward is the cashier spongebob is the cook for an instance method you
7:38:59
access an object then call the instance method with a static method you only
7:39:04
need to access that class you don't even need to create any objects from that class it's a general utility
7:39:12
method all right everybody those are static methods they're a method that belongs to a class rather than any
7:39:19
objects created from that class they're usually used for general utility functions that do not need access to
7:39:26
class data and well everybody those are static methods in Python hey what's going on people so
54.class methods
7:39:33
today I got to talk about class methods in Python a class method allows operations related to the class itself
7:39:40
they take CLS as the first parameter whereas instance methods will take self
7:39:46
self refers to any object created from that class cls meaning class refers to
7:39:51
the class not any objects here's an example we will create a class of
7:39:58
student we'll need a constructor to construct some student objects all students will have a name
7:40:06
and a GPA self.name equals name
7:40:14
self.gpa equals GPA we will also create a class variable for
7:40:20
this demonstration of count we will count how many students we
7:40:25
create whenever we construct a student object we will access the class of
7:40:31
student take our count variable incremented by one whenever we create a
7:40:37
student object increase count by one i will create an instance method of
7:40:44
get info instance methods have self as the
7:40:50
first parameter we're referring to the object we're currently working with i
7:40:55
will return an fstring where we will display the students name and their GPA
7:41:03
self.name name
7:41:08
self.gpa i'll add a comment that this is an instance
7:41:14
method now to create a class method to work with class data we will declare a
7:41:20
class method with a class method decorator class
7:41:26
method what we're going to do is define a method to get the count the class
7:41:31
variable of count this method will be called get
7:41:37
count rather than self as the first parameter we'll be working with a class
7:41:43
cls meaning class i will return an fstring total number of
7:41:53
students add a placeholder cls count let's test this to call a class
7:42:01
method you take the name of the class followed by the class method get count
7:42:07
and then we do need to print this what is the count of my current
7:42:15
students total number of students is zero let's create a few student
7:42:20
objects we will create student one equals call the student constructor we
7:42:26
have to pass in a name and a GPA let's say that the name is Spongebob spongebob
7:42:32
has a GPA of 3.2 we'll create two more students student two student three
7:42:40
student two will be Patrick patrick has a
7:42:46
2.0 then Sandy syy's smart in fact she's a genius she has a perfect
7:42:53
4.0 now let's count the number of students total number of students is
7:43:00
three when we call this class method we can access or modify class
7:43:06
data this class variable of count rather than using self we use CLS for the
7:43:14
class let's create one more class method this time I'll calculate the total GPA
7:43:20
of all my students we'll need a class variable to hold that data let's say total GPA
7:43:29
equals zero whenever we construct a student object we will access our class of
7:43:36
student get the total GPA then add plus equals this student's
7:43:44
GPA that we have just created basically speaking the total GPA this
7:43:50
variable is going to accumulate all of the GPA of every student and store it as
7:43:55
a sum to find the average we're going to divide it by the count the number of students we'll do that within a class
7:44:02
method to create a class method again we need to use the class method
7:44:07
decorator i will define a method of get average GPA the first parameter is cls
7:44:15
for class i will check if cls count the
7:44:22
count variable of my class is equal to zero that means if we have no students
7:44:29
if that's the case if there's no students we're going to return zero because otherwise we're going to
7:44:35
divide by zero and we'll get an error else we're going to return an f
7:44:42
string follow this formula we're going to take the total GPA of my class class
7:44:48
dot total GPA divided by class.c count the number of students we have that's
7:44:55
how to calculate the average GPA after getting the count of the number of students to access a class
7:45:02
method we take the name of the class student call the class method get
7:45:07
average GPA then I will print
7:45:15
it total number of students is three the average GPA is 3.06
7:45:22
repeating after calculating the average I'm going to add a format specifier of
7:45:27
2F just to round to two decimal places and I'll add average GPA colon space
7:45:36
then we'll calculate the average all right everybody those are
7:45:41
class methods instance methods are best for operations on instances of the class
7:45:47
any objects static methods are best for general utility functions which do not
7:45:53
need access to class data class methods are best used when we're working with
7:45:59
class level data or we require access to the class itself such as when we're
7:46:04
working with class variables rather than using self as the first parameter we're going to use cls meaning class and well
7:46:12
everybody those are class methods in Python yo what's going on people so
55.magic methods
7:46:18
today I'm going to explain magic methods in Python magic methods are also known as dunder methods meaning double
7:46:26
underscore you typically find these within classes we're already familiar with one of them our dunder init method
7:46:32
we have double underscores on the left and double underscores on the right but there are others i'll cover a few of the
7:46:38
more beginner friendly ones so what these methods do is that they're automatically called by using some of
7:46:45
Python's built-in operations such as printing an object seeing if two objects
7:46:50
are equal greater than or less than when we use many of Python's built-in operations with objects we can define
7:46:58
and customize the behavior of those objects so in this demonstration I'm going to create a class of book we will
7:47:05
construct some book objects we will define a magic method a dunder method of
7:47:11
init to initialize these objects for a book we need a title an author and the
7:47:19
number of pages we'll say num pages
7:47:25
self.title equals title self.author equals author
7:47:34
self dot number of pages equals number of pages when we
7:47:40
call the class of book we are automatically calling done a nit so let's create a book object book one
7:47:47
equals book we need a title an author and number of pages so since we're dealing
7:47:53
with this topic of magic methods I'll pick some fantasy related books for my first book I'll pick The
7:48:00
Hobbit that's the title the author is
7:48:05
JRR Tolken the number of pages is 310 so for my next
7:48:12
book book two I will pick Harry
7:48:19
Potter and the Philosopher
7:48:26
Stone the author is JK Rowling the number of pages is
7:48:34
223 then we have book three for my third book I will pick The
7:48:42
Lion The Witch and The
7:48:49
Wardrobe the author is CS Lewis the number of pages is 172 okay
7:48:58
here are my three book objects when we call the class of book and pass in arguments we will call the dunder init
7:49:05
method it's a magic method it's automatically called behind the scenes within this magic method we can define
7:49:12
and customize the behavior of objects and in this example we're just assigning the attributes of title author and
7:49:20
number of pages that is one built-in operation of Python what would happen if
7:49:25
I was to print book one directly to the console here's what happens well we're
7:49:32
given a memory address here's book two and book
7:49:37
three well we can customize this behavior we will use the dunder string
7:49:46
method double underscore str meaning string double underscore again we have
7:49:52
one parameter of self instead of returning a memory address we can customize this behavior
7:49:59
let's instead return an fstring i'll add two placeholders we
7:50:04
will display self.title the title of the book by
7:50:11
self.author and I'll place the title within single quotes now let's print book one we have
7:50:18
The Hobbit by JRR Tolken let's print book two
7:50:25
harry Potter and the Philosopher Stone by JK Rowling and book three The Lion
7:50:30
the Witch and the Wardrobe by CS Lewis so that is dunder string we can return a
7:50:36
string representation of the object when we print it directly to the console here's another dunder method we
7:50:43
can check to see if two objects are equal i will print is book one equal to book two
7:50:54
that gives me false if they were to have the same
7:50:59
title the same author and the same number of
7:51:05
pages then Python would say they're not equal still so let's customize this
7:51:13
behavior we will define a method of dunder equals which is just
7:51:19
EQ for parameters we have self the first book we're examining in this case book
7:51:24
one and other other means the other book we're examining two objects for
7:51:31
equality to do that we'll see if the title of two books and the author is the
7:51:37
same we'll disregard the number of pages you can have two different versions of
7:51:42
the same book they might have different font sizes or the dimensions of the physical pages might be
7:51:49
different so we will return a boolean value we will examine if self that's the
7:51:55
first book is the title attribute equal to our other book's
7:52:01
title and is the author of the first book self.author equal to our other book's
7:52:10
author if I were to run this we get false book one does not equal book two
7:52:16
but if they have the same title I'm going to replace these and the same
7:52:23
author then they would be equal and we'll disregard the number of pages
7:52:29
let's say that with this version of The Hobbit they're using a smaller font size so there's less
7:52:35
pages we're using dunder equals to compare if two objects are equal
7:52:41
what if I was to print book two is less than book three like what does that even
7:52:48
mean and I'm just going to get rid of these two lines type error less than is not
7:52:55
supported between instances of book and book so we can't use less than on two
7:53:01
objects but we can customize that behavior by using dunder less than which
7:53:07
is just lt we're examining one book and the other
7:53:12
book self and other let's compare the number of pages
7:53:18
we'll compare if the pages of book two is less than book three we will return a
7:53:24
boolean value is self dot number of
7:53:30
pages less than other number of pages so now this should not give us an
7:53:38
error book two does not have less pages than book three another would be greater
7:53:45
than i'll just copy what we have dunder GT for greater than for our first book
7:53:51
of self is it greater than the number of pages of the other
7:54:00
book well that's true the number of pages of book two is greater than book
7:54:05
three let's use dunder add to add the pages of two books together what would
7:54:10
happen if I were to add two books together book two plus book three well we get a type error
7:54:17
unsupported operand for book and book well to customize the behavior of
7:54:23
addition we will define dunder add we have self and other for the other
7:54:30
object let's add the pages together of two books maybe we need a summer reading
7:54:36
list and we would like to see what the total number of pages is i will return
7:54:42
self dot number of pages attribute plus
7:54:47
our other books number of pages that would give me
7:54:54
395 that's 223 + 172 heck I'll even put this within an F string cuz why
7:55:06
not then I will add the word pages 395
7:55:13
pages within an object we can search for a keyword within one of the attributes
7:55:19
so let's find the word lion within book three to do that I would write a statement like this
7:55:26
lion in book three type error argument of type book
7:55:33
is not iterable we will define dunder
7:55:40
contains besides self we will pass in a keyword a keyword that we're searching
7:55:46
for i will return then we'll use the in membership operator is our keyword in
7:55:56
self.title i'm looking for the word lion that's going to return true if lion is
7:56:02
in the title of this book or is our keyword in self.author maybe we're
7:56:09
searching for an author let's try that again that returns true lion is in book
7:56:17
three however Lion is not within book one that's
7:56:23
false is Rolling in book two that's the
7:56:28
author that is true is rolling in book three that is false that is dunder
7:56:36
contains we are searching for a keyword in an object
7:56:42
now we could search for a key given an object for book one we'll use the index
7:56:48
operator and look up an attribute let's get the title of book
7:56:54
one the default behavior is that we get a type error book object is not
7:57:01
subscriptable so to customize this behavior we will use dunder get
7:57:09
item besides self we have one parameter of key we're accessing book attributes
7:57:16
by indexing with this object return the value at this key what's that
7:57:22
attribute we will check if our key that we receive is equal to title which it is in
7:57:31
this case we will return self.title what's the title of the book
7:57:39
so that would give me the Hobbit here's book two and book
7:57:45
three what if the key is author none we didn't set that up
7:57:53
yet if key is equal to author then return
7:58:02
self.author the author of book three is CS Lewis
7:58:08
two is JK Rowling book one is JRR
7:58:14
Tolken what about number of pages num pages well we're not set up for that
7:58:22
yet i'm going to turn this into an else- if statement
7:58:27
else if key is equal to num
7:58:33
pages then we will return self.num
7:58:39
pages the number of pages in book one is 310 book two is
7:58:47
223 book three is 172 what if there is no key otherwise if there is no matching
7:58:54
key I'll add an else statement let's return an
7:59:01
fstring key placeholder our key that we pass in as
7:59:06
an argument was not found what do books not have well they
7:59:13
don't have audio I guess unless it's an audio book is there a key of audio in
7:59:18
book three there is not key audio was not found and I'll place that within
7:59:25
single quotes much better all right everybody so those are magic methods also known as
7:59:33
dunder methods meaning double underscore they are automatically called by many of Python's built-in operations they allow
7:59:40
developers to define or customize the behavior of objects when we use those
7:59:45
built-in operations and well everybody those are magic methods in Python
56.property ⚙️
7:59:51
hey everybody so in today's video I got to talk about the property decorator in Python the property decorator allows us
7:59:57
to define a method as a property we can access it like it's an attribute one of
8:00:03
the benefits is that when reading writing or deleting attributes we can add additional logic the property
8:00:09
decorator gives us a getter method to read a setter method to write and a deleter method to delete when working
8:00:16
with attributes in this example we'll create a class of rectangle we need a constructor let's
8:00:23
define that when constructing a rectangle object we will need a width and a
8:00:30
height we will assign the attribute of width equal to the width that we receive
8:00:36
when constructing this object self.height equals
8:00:42
height let's construct a rectangle object rectangle equals
8:00:49
rectangle we need to pass in a width and a height then I will print my
8:00:54
rectangle's width rectangle.width and the height
8:01:02
rectangle.height with my rectangle the width is three the height is four using the property decorator when reading
8:01:09
these attributes of width or height I can write some additional logic let's say that when accessing the width or the
8:01:15
height I would like to display one digit after the decimal then add centimeters
8:01:21
here's one way in which I can do that for each of these attributes I'm going to create a method we will define a
8:01:27
method of width no parameters besides self for now I'll write
8:01:33
pass and define height preceding each of these methods I
8:01:40
will use the property decorator so at property now when accessing the width or
8:01:47
the height we'll be returned with whatever is within these methods of width and height but there's one change we're
8:01:54
going to make to these attributes we'll set these attributes to be private prefix each of these attributes with an
8:02:01
underscore this tells you and other developers that these attributes they're meant to be protected they're internal
8:02:09
we shouldn't access the width or the height directly outside of this class technically we could i will access the
8:02:16
internal version of width and height we get three and four but we do have a warning access to a protected
8:02:23
member width of a class that applies to height as well our width and our height
8:02:28
are only meant to be used inside of this class if we need to get the width and the height we will do so through these
8:02:35
getter methods provided by the property decorator so when accessing the width
8:02:40
let's return an fstring I will access self dot private
8:02:48
width add a format specifier to display one digit after the
8:02:54
decimal.1f followed by centimeters we'll do this with the height as
8:02:59
well we will return self.private
8:03:05
height so now when we access the width or the height we will do so using these getter
8:03:12
methods if I access these private width and height attributes
8:03:18
instead again they will be three and four it's kind of like they're raw these
8:03:24
attributes are meant to be used internally inside of the class so that's the point of a getter method we can add
8:03:30
additional logic when reading one of these attributes when we try to get them
8:03:35
we can also add setter methods if we would like to set or write these attributes here's how let's take our
8:03:42
width we will create a decorator of at width setter when attempting to set the width
8:03:50
we will do so using this method we will define our method name of width we will have one parameter a new width we don't
8:03:59
want the parameter name to be the same as the method name that's why we're naming it something different
8:04:05
when setting the width let's check to see if the new width is greater than
8:04:11
zero if so we will take self.private width equals our new
8:04:19
width else let's print something let's
8:04:24
print width must be greater than
8:04:30
zero and let's do this with the
8:04:36
height heights setter define height pass
8:04:41
in a new height if our new height is greater than zero assign self.private height
8:04:51
equals the new height else print height must be greater than
8:04:58
zero before printing the width and the height let's take our rectangles width set it to be zero then
8:05:05
see what happens well we get that message width must be greater than zero if I were to
8:05:13
set width to be five well that does work our width is now five let's change the
8:05:20
height rectangle i will set this to be -1
8:05:27
height must be greater than zero and the height hasn't changed what about six six does work when using these
8:05:36
setter methods we can add additional logic when writing or changing one of these attributes these are setter
8:05:43
methods now if you need to delete an attribute here's
8:05:49
how there is a delete keyword we will delete our rectangle's
8:05:54
width and delete our rectangle's height in this series we really won't be using the delete keyword but you should still
8:06:00
know that it exists so we will create a deleter method at take one of the attributes in
8:06:09
this example width we will create a deleter method the method name will be
8:06:15
width the name of the attribute there will be no parameters besides
8:06:21
self we will delete self.private private width then
8:06:28
let's print something just to confirm that this was deleted width has been deleted same
8:06:36
thing applies to height take the attribute of height
8:06:43
define height delete private
8:06:49
height height has been deleted
8:06:55
when deleting our width or our height we get that confirmation message width has been deleted and height has been
8:07:02
deleted all right everybody so that is the property decorator we can define a method as a property meaning it can be
8:07:10
accessed as if it was an attribute one of the benefits is that we can add additional logic when we read write or
8:07:17
delete attributes the property decorator gives us a getter setter and deleter method getter methods to read setter
8:07:25
methods to write and deleter methods to delete and well everybody that is the
8:07:30
property decorator in Python what is going on everybody so today I got to talk about decorators in
57.decorators
8:07:37
Python a decorator is a function that extends the behavior of another function
8:07:43
without modifying that base function we pass the base function as an argument to the decorator function for example let's
8:07:50
say we have a base function of get ice cream and you can pass in a flavor of ice cream well some people might want
8:07:56
sprinkles on their ice cream and others may not they might just want plain vanilla well we could add sprinkles by
8:08:02
using a decorator we're extending the behavior of a function where we get ice cream where we're adding sprinkles but
8:08:09
we may not want to change the base function because some people don't like sprinkles think of decorators that way
8:08:14
we're adding something to a base function without changing it here's how to create a decorator let's start with
8:08:20
the base function we will create a function to get ice cream there will be
8:08:26
no parameters for now all we're going to do is print the following
8:08:32
message here is your ice cream and for fun I'll add an emoji because I like
8:08:39
emojis i'll add an ice cream emoji to call this function all I got to do is
8:08:45
call the get ice cream function here is your ice cream here's how to create a
8:08:52
decorator a decorator is a function we'll need to define it define add
8:08:59
sprinkles our decorator function is going to have one parameter a function
8:09:06
but we'll just rename it to funk for short we're going to pass a function to our decorator function
8:09:14
within our decorator function we will define an inner function of
8:09:19
wrapper currently there's no parameters we'll set that up later within this wrapper function we
8:09:26
will call the function that we receive this parameter then we will return our
8:09:34
wrapper function up until this point we've been returning values but now we're going to return an entire function
8:09:41
here's the basic formula to create a decorator to apply a decorator to a base
8:09:46
function preceding that function you're going to add at the name of the
8:09:52
decorator so add sprinkles is a decorator the base function is get ice
8:09:57
cream within our decorator how do we want to add sprinkles exactly currently
8:10:03
our decorator doesn't do anything here's what happens we just print here is your
8:10:08
ice cream let's say that before we're given our ice cream we'll print a statement that we add
8:10:14
sprinkles within our decorator imagine that we're replacing calling function
8:10:20
with this print statement let's create another print statement where we add sprinkles before
8:10:27
it i will print the following
8:10:33
message you add sprinkles and I'll add an emoji
8:10:38
how about confetti that could resemble sprinkles okay let's see what
8:10:45
happens you add sprinkles here is your ice cream we're decorating our base function
8:10:52
of get ice cream with a decorator of add sprinkles we're not modifying the base
8:10:58
function we're extending it now we have a nested function of wrapper within our
8:11:03
decorator it is necessary to have this here's why so I'm not going to call the
8:11:09
get ice cream function quite yet so nothing should happen if I was to remove this
8:11:21
wrapper well we'll end up calling this function as soon as we apply the decorator we're not even calling the get
8:11:28
ice cream function at all we only want to execute this code when we want ice cream not whenever we apply the
8:11:34
decorator that's why we need that wrapper
8:11:40
function we'll get ice cream and add sprinkles only when we call that
8:11:46
function then at any point in my program if I call the get ice cream
8:11:52
function then we get ice cream with sprinkles let's apply more than one
8:11:58
decorator we'll create a decorator to add fudge define add fudge
8:12:06
we have one parameter a function which we will rename as funk we need an inner
8:12:11
wrapper function this is so that we don't call this function when we apply a
8:12:18
decorator i will print you add
8:12:29
fudge close enough we'll add a bar of chocolate
8:12:34
then call the base function that we receive then we need to return the wrapper
8:12:41
function all right given our base function we can apply more than one decorator let's say that after adding
8:12:48
sprinkles we will apply the decorator where we add fudge so
8:12:54
now we have the following output you add sprinkles you add fudge
8:13:00
here is your ice cream so with decorators you can apply more than one decorator to a base
8:13:06
function what if your base function accepts arguments for example when we get our ice cream we need to pass in a
8:13:13
flavor like vanilla i will set up one parameter a
8:13:19
flavor i will convert our print statement to be an string here is your
8:13:25
add a placeholder flavor of ice cream let's run this and see what
8:13:33
happens all right we have a type error our wrapper function isn't set up
8:13:39
to accept arguments what you'll see within wrapper functions is that they'll have parameters of
8:13:44
args and quarks to accept any number of arguments and keyword arguments
8:13:51
then when you call your base function in this case get ice cream we
8:13:57
will also set this up to accept any number of arguments and keyword arguments let's do that within our add
8:14:03
fudge decorator too our wrapper function will accept any number of arguments and
8:14:08
keyword arguments same thing goes with the base function and now this should work
8:14:14
you add sprinkles you add fudge here is your vanilla ice cream or any other flavor of your
8:14:21
choosing like chocolate you add sprinkles you add
8:14:27
fudge here is your chocolate ice cream all right everybody so those are
8:14:32
decorators they're a function that extend the behavior of a base function
8:14:37
in this case get ice cream decorators extend a function without modifying it
8:14:42
if you would like to apply a decorator to a function you preede that function when you define it with at the name of
8:14:49
the decorator and you can apply more than one and well everybody that is an introduction to decorators in
8:14:56
Python hey everybody so today I got to talk about exception handling in Python an exception is an event that interrupts
58.exception handling
8:15:04
the normal flow of a program there are many different types of exceptions which include but are not limited to zero
8:15:10
division error exceptions when you attempt to divide a number by zero for example 1 divided by 0 that would
8:15:17
interrupt our program we have a zero division error another is a type error that's if we attempt to perform an
8:15:24
operation of a value that's of the wrong data type for example one plus a string
8:15:29
of one that would give us a type error unsupported operand for int and string
8:15:36
value errors tend to happen when you attempt to type cast a value of the wrong data type so let's say we attempt
8:15:42
to type cast the word pizza as an integer well pizza isn't a number we
8:15:49
have a value error invalid literal for int base with 10 pizza so exceptions
8:15:56
will interrupt our program if they're not handled gracefully and here's how we can do that there's three steps we can
8:16:03
write a try accept and finally block any code that's dangerous where it could
8:16:09
cause an error you'll place within a try block for example anytime we accept user input that is considered dangerous code
8:16:17
because a user can type in anything so let's say we have a number number equals
8:16:23
we will accept some user input we will tell a user to enter a number
8:16:30
then we're going to type cast it as an integer then I'm going to
8:16:37
print 1 / whatever the user types in if I were to type in zero we get a
8:16:44
zero division error if I type in the word pizza we get a value error we would like to prevent
8:16:52
our program from stopping this code is considered dangerous a user can really
8:16:57
type in anything so we're going to surround this code within a try block we'll type try colon and then
8:17:05
indent any code underneath it we're going to try this code if an exception
8:17:11
happens we will move on to step two subsequently following the try block we will add an accept
8:17:18
block if we run into one of these exceptions we can execute some alternative code for example a zero
8:17:25
division error if somebody attempts to divide a number by zero we can take a
8:17:30
different course of action instead of our program crashing and coming to a halt let's
8:17:37
print you can't divide by
8:17:43
zero idiot let's attempt to divide by zero enter a number
8:17:49
zero you can't divide by zero idiot we have gracefully handled this exception
8:17:56
so now let's say somebody types in the word pizza when we're asking for a number well we have a value error well
8:18:03
we can chain accept blocks if we encounter a value error let's add an accept block for that
8:18:11
accept value error we're going to
8:18:16
print enter only numbers
8:18:22
please enter a number i'll type in the word pizza enter only numbers please
8:18:28
that's good we're not interrupting our program now what you may see some people do is they will just catch all
8:18:35
exceptions except exception now this is actually
8:18:40
considered bad practice exception will catch all exceptions however it's too
8:18:46
broad of a clause it's good practice to tell the user what went wrong exactly if we
8:18:52
resort to just catching all exceptions you may see an error message such as
8:18:57
something went wrong i'm looking at you Microsoft we want to tell the user what
8:19:04
went wrong exactly i would only catch all exceptions as a last resort first
8:19:09
let's try and tell the user what went wrong exactly so I'm going to undo all this
8:19:16
code if there's an exception that occurs it's not a zero division error and it's
8:19:21
not a value error then we can add that catch all where we catch any unseen
8:19:27
exceptions now lastly we have the finally block the finally block always
8:19:32
executes regardless if there's an exception or not it's usually used for any sort of cleanup that you need to do
8:19:39
such as if you're handling files you may try and open a file and then you want to
8:19:44
be sure to close that file when you're done with it that would be handled within the finally block but we'll get
8:19:50
to file handling pretty soon in the next topic so just for the time being I'm going to
8:19:56
print do some cleanup here all right let's test this enter a
8:20:03
number i'm going to divide by zero you can't divide by zero and we still
8:20:09
execute the finally block enter a number i'll enter in one
8:20:15
1 / 1 is 1 and we still execute that finally block the finally block will be
8:20:22
more useful in future videos all you need to know is that it always executes regardless if there's an exception or
8:20:28
not all right everybody so that's exception handling an exception is an event that interrupts the normal flow of
8:20:34
a program there are many different types of exceptions you can always look under the official Python documentation for an
8:20:40
extensive list and well everybody that's exception handling in Python hey what's going on everybody
59.file detection 🕵️‍♂️
8:20:47
today I'm going to show you how we can handle basic file detection using Python this topic is the first of many
8:20:53
involving a minieries on file handling using Python first we'll need to cover file detection before we read and write
8:21:00
files to work with files using Python we will import the OS module os means
8:21:06
operating system this module provides a way for Python programs to interact with the operating system be sure to import
8:21:13
the OS module at the top for my demonstration within my project folder
8:21:19
I'm going to create a new file new file i will name this file test and this will
8:21:25
be a plain text file it will have the file extension of .txt this file really doesn't need to
8:21:32
say anything i'm just going to type I like pizza because I do the context doesn't matter we're not
8:21:39
going to be reading files in this video for convenience I'm going to assign a variable of file
8:21:45
path this will be a string for file detection we can either use a relative
8:21:51
file path or an absolute file path we'll cover relative file paths first these
8:21:57
two files are right next to each other my main Python file and my test file if
8:22:02
we're using a relative file path I only need the file name including the extension
8:22:09
test.txt we'll be passing in the string of file path as an argument to check to
8:22:15
see if this file exists I will use an if statement if access the OS
8:22:20
module access the path there is a built-in method of
8:22:27
exists we'll pass in our file path as the argument this method returns a
8:22:32
boolean value of true or false if this file exists so if this file does exist
8:22:40
test.txt let's print the following i'll use an
8:22:46
fstring the location I'll add a placeholder exists
8:22:54
i will place my file path within that placeholder and I'll surround it with
8:22:59
single quotes to make it look nice if this method returns true do
8:23:05
this else we'll do something else i will print that
8:23:12
location doesn't exist all right let's see what
8:23:19
happens the location test.txt txt exists now what if I get the extension
8:23:25
wrong let's say that I'm looking for a PDF but it's really a txt
8:23:31
file well that location doesn't exist you do have to be sure to get the file
8:23:36
extension correct what if this file was in a
8:23:41
folder within my Python project i will create a new directory i will name this directory
8:23:48
stuff then I will place my test file within the stuff folder pycharm wants me to refactor my
8:23:56
code because the location changed i'm not going to do that i'm going to be sure that this box is unchecked and
8:24:03
press refactor we're using a relative file path that test file is no longer
8:24:08
next to my main Python file here's what happens that location doesn't
8:24:14
exist with our relative file path we'll have to navigate to our stuff folder
8:24:19
then find the test file so preceding this file name I will access the stuff
8:24:25
folder stuff/ the name of the file test.txt and now we can locate that file
8:24:33
the location stuff/est exists when working with
8:24:38
relative file paths you may need to open up a folder then find your file you also could work with absolute
8:24:46
file paths so for this demonstration on my desktop I'm going to create a new
8:24:51
file new text document
8:24:58
test if I were to look at the properties this is a txt file a text
8:25:04
document i'm going to copy the location within my file path i will
8:25:12
paste it then list the name of the file test.txt
8:25:17
this is an absolute file path one problem we're running into when working with strings a backslash does serve as
8:25:25
an escape sequence python thinks we're trying to print a tab character we can
8:25:30
solve this with double backslashes or we could use a forward
8:25:37
slash either one works all right let's see if that file exists that
8:25:44
does the location of that absolute file path does exist if I were to get the extension
8:25:50
wrong let's say this is a PDF well that location doesn't
8:25:58
exist there is a built-in method of is file to check to see if that file is in fact a file and not a directory let's
8:26:05
add the following after we detect this file we'll write a nested if statement if
8:26:14
Oos.path dot is file then pass in our file path as an
8:26:21
argument if this file is in fact a file and not a directory I will
8:26:28
print that is a file the location of that absolute file
8:26:35
path does exist that is a file what if it was a directory a folder
8:26:42
i'm going to delete this go to new folder i will name this folder
8:26:50
test to check to see if a location is a directory let's add an else- if statement else if
8:26:59
ospath dot is dur meaning is directory this is a method we'll pass in
8:27:06
our file path if this is a directory a folder I will print that is a
8:27:16
directory let's run this again that location doesn't exist oh we have to get
8:27:21
rid of the file extension it is not a plain text
8:27:28
file the location of that absolute file path exists that is a directory a
8:27:35
folder all right everybody that's basic file detection in the next few videos
8:27:41
we're going to be reading and writing files and well everybody that is basic file detection using Python hey what's
60.writing files
8:27:48
going on everybody in today's video I'm going to show you how we can write and output files using Python we'll cover
8:27:54
plain text JSON and CSV files but we'll start with plain text because it's the
8:27:59
easiest suppose we have some data that we would like to output i'll create a variable of text data
8:28:06
think of a food you like i will output I like pizza for convenience we'll create a
8:28:14
variable a file path this can be a relative file path or an absolute file path within this file path we'll need a
8:28:22
name for this file i will name this output then include the file extension
8:28:27
this will be a .txt file a plain text file this is a relative file path when I
8:28:33
generate this file it will be within the same project folder as my main Python file to create a file we'll write the
8:28:42
following with open function pass in our file
8:28:48
path and a character of W to write as
8:28:53
file and for now I'll write pass there's a few things going on here width is a
8:28:59
statement it's used to wrap a block of code to execute if we open a file the
8:29:05
width statement will also close that file when we're done with it so we don't need to manually close files when you
8:29:11
open a file it is good practice to close it because if you don't you may run into unexpected behavior the width statement
8:29:18
takes care of that for you the open function will return a file object the
8:29:24
first parameter is the file path the second parameter is the mode w is write
8:29:29
x will also write if this file doesn't exist if it already does exist we'll
8:29:35
receive an error a is for append to append a file and R is to read but we'll
8:29:40
take care of reading in the next video so we will stick with W to write a file the open function returns a file object
8:29:48
the first argument is the file the second argument is the mode you
8:29:54
can set these to be keyword arguments if it's easier for you to read when the open function returns a
8:30:01
file object for us we're using the as keyword to give it a name as file it's
8:30:07
kind of like we're instantiating a file object file equals file file is the name
8:30:13
of the file object to write to this file we're going to take our file object use
8:30:19
the built-in write method then pass in our text data then when this is done I'm going to
8:30:26
print a confirmation message i'll use an fring let's say text
8:30:33
file i'll add our file path place it within single
8:30:40
quotes was created let's see what happens
8:30:46
text file output.txt was created and here's that file i like
8:30:53
pizza we also have the capability of setting an absolute file path let's say
8:30:59
I would like to output this file to my desktop i would just need that location let me just get the location from one of
8:31:05
these folders by going to properties i will copy this location
8:31:10
this is the location to my desktop but for you it's probably going to be different then I will paste the absolute
8:31:18
file path a backslash is an escape sequence within a string we either could
8:31:23
use double backslashes or a forward
8:31:31
slash now let's see if this outputs to my desktop text file here's the file path
8:31:39
was created and here's that file it's a plain text file and it
8:31:46
says I like pizza so when working with the file path
8:31:53
it can be a relative file path or an absolute file path all right now for our
8:31:58
text data there are different modes as well w is for write if we use X we'll
8:32:05
write a file if that file doesn't already exist in this case it does on my desktop we already have a file named
8:32:12
output and it's a plain text file so when I run this with the mode of X we
8:32:19
get a file exists error that file already exists we could catch this
8:32:25
exception so that our program isn't interrupted i will copy the name of this
8:32:31
error i will place my code within a try block we will try this code and catch
8:32:37
any exceptions except file exists error if this file
8:32:44
already exists let's take a different course of action let's print that file
8:32:51
already exists so now when I run this again our
8:32:57
program isn't interrupted we receive this message that file already exists
8:33:04
if I were to delete that file bye-bye then run this
8:33:11
again well we create a new file text file that absolute file path was created
8:33:18
and here it is again now for the mode there's also a a to append any new data will be appended
8:33:26
to that file we get I like pizza i like pizza
8:33:33
when appending data if you would like that data on a new line we can add a new line character w will overwrite a
8:33:43
file so we're back to the original when appending either before or
8:33:49
after we write our text data we could add a new line character let's say let's
8:33:54
do that before new line plus our text data
8:34:00
here's the output again we're appending not writing i like pizza i like pizza our
8:34:07
second sentence is on a new line let's run this a couple times we should have several lines
8:34:18
now let's work with a collection let's say we have a list of
8:34:23
employees we'll pick some employees at the Krusty Krab so we have Eugene i
8:34:28
guess he's technically the manager i don't know if that counts as an employee
8:34:35
squidward Spongebob and Patrick patrick worked at the Krusty Krab in one episode he
8:34:42
counts then we'll have to be sure we're writing our employees this is what's going to
8:34:49
happen we have a type error write argument must be a string not a list
8:34:55
in order for us to write each item within a list we'll need to iterate over it using some sort of loop we can't
8:35:02
write a list or any other collection directly here's what we'll change for
8:35:08
every employee in our collection of
8:35:15
employees we're iterating over something that is iterable
8:35:20
we will access our file object use the write method then write each
8:35:27
employee here's the result we get one long string of each
8:35:34
item in this list if you prefer after writing each
8:35:39
employee we could add a new line character
8:35:46
after and here's the output we get each item in our list on a new
8:35:53
line or rather than a new line character we could use a space this would output all the
8:36:00
employees but space them out now we'll be outputting a JSON file
8:36:05
in summary a JSON file is made of key value pairs for our data let's say we
8:36:12
have a dictionary of employee a dictionary is made of key value pairs
8:36:18
we'll have a name of Spongebob spongebob's age will be
8:36:28
30 his job his position is that he is a
8:36:34
cook so this is the data I would like to output i'll keep the file path the same
8:36:39
we'll change the file extension to JSON we will need the help of the JSON module
8:36:46
let's be sure to import that import JSON within our width block we'll make
8:36:52
the following change we're going to access our JSON module use the dump method the dump
8:37:00
method will convert our dictionary to a JSON string to output it so we have to
8:37:06
pass in our JSON data of employee our file as the second
8:37:13
argument then for a confirmation message let's print JSON file was created here's
8:37:19
the result json file at this location was
8:37:25
created and here's my JSON file i'll go to properties we'll confirm it is a JSON
8:37:31
file it is and I'll open it here's the
8:37:36
result now you could add indentation after each key value pair here's
8:37:41
how after our second argument our file we can pass in a keyword argument of
8:37:48
indent for each key value pair by how many spaces do we want to indent each
8:37:54
let's say four and let's take a look i think
8:38:00
that's more readable we're indenting each key value pair by four spaces so that is a JSON file it's a
8:38:08
collection of key value pairs a dictionary or anything that uses
8:38:13
key value pairs is a great candidate to be output to a JSON file all right now we're going to work
8:38:20
with CSV files csv means commaepparated values csv files are pretty common with
8:38:27
a spreadsheet of data like an Excel spreadsheet we will create a 2D data structure of
8:38:34
employees this will be a list of lists let's add
8:38:46
four we'll need the help of the CSV module import
8:38:52
CSV think of our 2D data structure as a table of rows and columns so for the
8:38:58
first row I will add name age comm
8:39:07
job the second row will have a name of Spongebob age 30 job cook for the next
8:39:16
row we'll have Patrick patrick will be
8:39:22
37 what is Patrick's job i don't know he's
8:39:29
unemployed then we'll have Sandy sandy will be
8:39:35
27 sandy is a scientist okay now with our file path
8:39:42
the file extension is going to be a CSV file commaepparated values within the
8:39:48
context of our width block we're going to create a writer object to write to a
8:39:54
file writer equals access the CSV module
8:39:59
use the writer method of that module then pass in our
8:40:04
file writer is an object it provides methods for writing data to a CSV
8:40:10
file and then we'll print a confirmation message of CSV file was created here's
8:40:16
the output currently we have a CSV file i'll go to
8:40:22
properties to confirm it well we have no output we have to
8:40:29
iterate over all the rows in our 2D collection we'll write the following for
8:40:35
every row in our data of
8:40:41
employees we'll take our writer object use the write row method and pass in
8:40:48
that row that we're iterating over now let's take a look
8:40:56
that's better however the writer method gives us a new line after each
8:41:02
row so if we would like to prevent that when we open this file I will set the keyword argument of
8:41:10
new line equal to no characters an empty
8:41:16
string let's take a look again yeah that's much better so this is
8:41:22
a CSV file it's made of commaepparated values all right everybody so that is an
8:41:30
introduction to writing files using Python what's going on everybody today
61.reading files
8:41:35
I'm going to show you how we can read files using Python we'll cover plain text JSON and CSV files in the previous
8:41:43
topic we have created some sample files to work with here is my plain text
8:41:48
file my JSON file and my CSV file they're all named
8:41:55
input they each have a different file extension for convenience I will create
8:42:00
a variable of file path we can list a relative file path or
8:42:05
an absolute file path i'll use an absolute file path i'm going to right click on the file I would like to read
8:42:12
go to properties copy the location then paste it then add the file
8:42:19
name including the extension input and this is a .txt file within the context of a string
8:42:27
backslashes are escape sequences for special characters we would either need to use double backslashes or a forward
8:42:35
slash here is the absolute file path to the file I would like to
8:42:41
read to read this file I will add a width block width is a statement it's
8:42:48
going to wrap a block of code within a context manager and it'll close a file if we open it it is good practice to
8:42:55
close a file if you do open it if you don't it can lead to unexpected behavior we will use the open function the open
8:43:02
function has two arguments our file path and a
8:43:08
mode to read a file we'll set the mode to be R for read the open function is going to
8:43:15
return a file object which we will give a nickname of file as
8:43:23
file when we read our file object it's going to return one long string which we
8:43:29
will assign to a variable named content content equals file use the read method
8:43:36
and assign it to this variable then I'm going to print the content print our content the content of
8:43:44
the file here's the result that is the content of my file i
8:43:50
like pizza it's really good let's say we can't find this file
8:43:57
perhaps I forget the file extension we'll run into a file not found error
8:44:03
this will interrupt our program we can catch exceptions when they happen any dangerous code that may cause an
8:44:10
exception we can wrap within a try block if there's an exception we will
8:44:16
catch them by stating except the name of the exception in this case file not
8:44:22
found error instead of our program being interrupted let's take a different
8:44:27
course of action we will print that file was not found let's try this
8:44:37
again that file was not found at least our program isn't being
8:44:42
interrupted let's add the file extension back what if we don't have permission to
8:44:47
read this file to demonstrate that I'm going to rightclick on that file go to properties
8:44:55
go to security edit the permissions i will deny any sort of
8:45:02
control i will attempt to read this file and we get a permission error permission
8:45:07
denied we could handle this exception as well if we encounter a permission error
8:45:15
I will print the following you do not have
8:45:21
permission to read that file let's run this again you do not have permission to
8:45:28
read that file those are a few exceptions we can handle in case they appear file not
8:45:34
found errors and permission errors let's say we would like to read a JSON file we
8:45:40
will need the help of the JSON module i will import the JSON module at the top of my
8:45:46
program I need to get the file path of this JSON file it's pretty much the same as before
8:45:52
in this case the file extension is a JSON file
8:46:01
there's only one change we're going to make we will assign our variable of content equal to access the JSON module
8:46:10
use the load method and load our file and that should read the contents of my
8:46:16
file here's my JSON file name Spongebob age 30 job
8:46:23
cook with the data of your JSON file you could access a value given a key i will
8:46:30
access our content by its key of name that will return the value of Spongebob
8:46:37
age 30 job
8:46:42
cook now here's how to read a CSV file we will import the CSV module the file
8:46:50
extension is going to be CSV again this is on my desktop in the same location as the previous files my content will equal
8:46:58
access the CSV module access the reader method and pass
8:47:04
in our file here's the content currently we're given
8:47:10
a memory address with a CSV file what we need to do is read the CSV file line by line all
8:47:18
of the data is within a collection which we need to iterate over so to do that we're going to create
8:47:26
a for loop for every line in my content
8:47:31
I will print each line That's much better the format resembles
8:47:39
a spreadsheet like an Excel spreadsheet there's
8:47:44
rows and columns to get a specified column we can
8:47:51
access an index in my example our line at index of zero would give me the first
8:47:58
column name Spongebob Patrick Sandy the next index would be all the
8:48:05
ages of each person 30 35 27 and index two would be the job
8:48:12
positions cook unemployed and scientist if you need a specific column
8:48:19
of data from a CSV file you can use an index as one possibility all right
8:48:24
everybody so those are a few ways in which we can read files using Python hey what's going on everybody so
62.dates & times
8:48:31
in today's video I'm going to show you how we can work with dates and times using Python we will import the date
8:48:38
time module this allows us to work with dates and times using our system clock
8:48:43
our computer's clock this video serves as more of an introduction to create a date object we will assign an object of
8:48:50
date let me zoom in a little bit we will access the datetime module
8:48:56
call the date method within the date method we will pass in the following arguments a year of our choosing so for
8:49:04
me I'll say 2025 a month one corresponds to January these are numeric months and
8:49:11
a day a day of the month i will say the second if I was to print the state
8:49:18
object here's what it outputs the year is 2025 January
8:49:25
2nd to get the date right now let's say today this will return a date object
8:49:32
that represents today access the date time module access the class of date then
8:49:40
call the today method to return the date of today let's print today currently I'm
8:49:47
recording this video July 14th 2024 for me that is the result of my
8:49:53
today object when I print it now we'll work with time i will create a time
8:49:58
object access the datetime module call the time method we have to
8:50:05
pass in hours minutes and then seconds so for the hour let's say 12 30 and 0
8:50:12
seconds i will print the current time it is 12:30
8:50:19
now to get the time right now on our system clock I will create a datetime
8:50:25
object of now equals access the datetime module now within the datetime module
8:50:32
there is a datetime class we have to access we will access that I know it
8:50:37
looks kind of silly datetimed datetime dot the now method so we're accessing
8:50:44
the datetime module there is a built-in datetime class we have access then
8:50:49
within that class there's a now method what is the time right now
8:50:55
according to my system clock this returns a date and a time
8:51:00
july 14th 2024 it is just after 9:00 a.m we can format the appearance of the
8:51:08
string here's how i'm going to reassign our datetime
8:51:13
object of now our datetime object has a string
8:51:19
format time method strf time we're going to pass in
8:51:25
a string and include some format specifiers let's say I would like to display the hour first i'm going to add
8:51:32
a percent these format specifiers you can find according to the datetime documentation online so I will display
8:51:40
the hours that would be percent H percent M for
8:51:48
minutes percent S for seconds let's see what we're working
8:51:53
with we have the hours the minutes and the seconds i will separate each of
8:51:59
these with a colon that's
8:52:04
better now I'll add the date i'll start with the month i will add a format
8:52:10
specifier of lowercase M then the day a format specifier of D
8:52:18
then the year format specifier capital Y here's the
8:52:24
result we have the month the day and the year I'll add a dash to separate
8:52:33
these better or if you prefer the day first rather than the We can switch this
8:52:40
around it depends on how you read dates in your country now we're going to cover an exercise we're going to see if the
8:52:47
current date and time has passed a target date and time so we are going to
8:52:52
create a target date time equals access the datetime
8:53:00
module we will create a new date time so now we have to pass in a date and a
8:53:08
time for my date time let's say it's something far into the future like the year 2030 January
8:53:15
2nd for the hour it will be 12 30 and 1
8:53:21
second i'm going to get the time right now which I will name current
8:53:28
datetime equals access the datetime module access the datetime class call
8:53:36
the now method to return the current date and time right now using an if statement I will see if
8:53:44
our target date time is less than the current date
8:53:51
time have we already passed this date if our target date is less than the current
8:53:57
date that means this date and time has already passed i will print the
8:54:03
following if that's the case target date has passed
8:54:11
else I will print target
8:54:18
date has not passed here's the
8:54:23
result target date has not passed what if I set the target date to the year
8:54:30
2020 well then the target date has passed so that's how we can check to see
8:54:36
if a date and time has already passed has it elapsed all right everybody so that is an
8:54:42
introduction to working with dates and times using Python all right everybody so in today's
63.alarm clock
8:54:48
video we're going to create a working alarm clock using [Music]
8:54:57
Python for this project we will need the following imports we will import time
8:55:03
we'll be updating our clock every second the time module is going to help us with that as well as import date time the
8:55:12
datetime module allows us to work with string representations of a time in my opinion the easiest way to work with
8:55:19
sound effects is to actually use pygame so we will import
8:55:24
pygame now you may need to download the pygame package here I'm getting a message that there's no module named
8:55:31
pygame there might be a link to install it even too one way in which you can download the Pygame package is to open
8:55:38
up a terminal then use pip pip is Python's package manager pip install
8:55:47
Pygame all right we have our three imports let's create a function to set
8:55:54
alarm we have one parameter an alarm time and for now I'll write
8:56:02
pass our alarm time parameter is going to be a string representation of a time
8:56:08
in military time i would like to start this program if I'm running my main Python file
8:56:14
directly i can add the following if statement if dunder name is equal to a
8:56:21
string of dunder main if we are running this main Python file directly then we
8:56:28
will set the alarm but first we have to prompt the user what they would like to set the alarm to so we will define a
8:56:34
variable of alarm time equals ask for some user input using the input function
8:56:42
we will prompt the user to enter the alarm time and give a
8:56:48
format hours minutes and seconds again this is going to be in
8:56:55
military time once we have our alarm time we will call the set alarm function
8:57:01
and pass in our alarm time all right we are now within the set
8:57:07
alarm function when we call this function let's print the following i'll use an
8:57:13
fstring alarm set for then include the alarm
8:57:19
time you will need an MP3 file to work with if you don't have one available
8:57:25
here's one recommendation you could use YouTube's audio library and then search for sound
8:57:31
effects or some music these audio files are only allowed for non-commercial use
8:57:36
outside of YouTube so you can search for a song or some sound effects find one that you
8:57:42
like and download it once you find a song that you like move it to your project folder
8:57:51
now I will create a variable of sound file equals this will be a relative or
8:57:58
absolute file path my MP3 file is right next to my main Python file i only need
8:58:04
to list the file name i named mine my music and this is an MP3 file i'm going
8:58:10
to perform a test run we're not going to play our sound quite yet we do have this output that displays
8:58:17
that says hello from the Pygame community let's say I set my alarm to 9:00 a.m then enter alarm set for 9:00
8:58:26
a.m if you would like to suppress this output for Pygame we can navigate to our virtual environment go to library Pygame
8:58:35
underneath this file named dunder init let's scroll all the way to the
8:58:42
bottom and we should have this if statement we
8:58:48
display the version of Pygame we're using and a print statement of hello from the Pygame community we could
8:58:54
comment this out or even just delete it that is the most simple
8:58:59
solution so we shouldn't get that message anymore we're going to create a boolean
8:59:06
variable of is running is our alarm clock running i will set that to be true
8:59:14
while is running while this is true we will continue the alarm
8:59:20
clock we need to get the current time current time equals we will access the
8:59:28
datetime module access the class of date time call the now method to get the time
8:59:36
and date right now we could method chain the string format method strf
8:59:43
time I would like the hours minutes and seconds but not the date so we will type
8:59:50
percent h colon let me zoom out a little
8:59:55
percent m for minutes and percent s for seconds
9:00:01
we're getting the hours minutes and seconds of the date and time right now
9:00:07
and storing it within this variable of current time then I'm going to print the current
9:00:15
time we'll perform a test run however currently we're within an infinite loop
9:00:20
at the end of the while loop I'll set is running to be
9:00:26
false okay enter the alarm time let's say 10:00 a.m alarm set for 10:00 a.m and the time
9:00:34
for me right now is 9:42 and 16 seconds we'll get rid of this line where
9:00:40
we set is running to be false instead I'm going to access the time module and
9:00:46
call the sleep method we will pass in a number of seconds to sleep so 1 second
9:00:53
i'll set the alarm to be 10:00 a.m now the time should update every second which it
9:01:01
is however when the current time is equal to the alarm time we have to
9:01:06
trigger the alarm so after printing the current time
9:01:13
we will write an if statement to check if the current time is equal to the
9:01:19
alarm time if this is true then let's print the
9:01:25
following wake
9:01:30
up and I'll add an emoji cuz it's silly once our alarm triggers we will
9:01:37
set is running to be false within this if statement let's do a test run we're not
9:01:43
going to play the sound quite yet i will set the alarm to 9:45
9:01:51
and then I'll come back a little bit
9:01:56
later all right once the current time matches the alarm time we print wake up and set is
9:02:05
running to be false to exit the while loop and then subsequently exiting the
9:02:10
program now we need to play an MP3 file we will access our package of
9:02:18
Pygame access the module of mixer so mixer is a module for loading
9:02:25
and playing sounds but we have to initialize it but we're going to initialize it with init to
9:02:33
initialize the initialize method is another way to call the constructor we can pass in some keyword arguments for
9:02:40
the frequency size channels buffer all that but that might be a little too
9:02:45
complicated for us at this level we'll use the default settings by not passing in anything the next step is to load our
9:02:52
sound file access the package of pygame access the module of
9:02:59
mixer access the module of music then call the load method we will load our
9:03:06
sound file our sound file contains the file
9:03:12
path to our MP3 file once we load our music we have to play it
9:03:21
pygamemixer music call the play method our MP3 file is only going to
9:03:28
play for a brief second i'll demonstrate that i will set the alarm to
9:03:35
949 and just give it a few seconds
9:03:43
our sound file stops playing when the program terminates what we need to do
9:03:49
next is continue playing our sound file while that sound file is busy we will
9:03:55
add a while loop file access
9:04:03
pygamemixer dot music call the get busy
9:04:09
method this returns a boolean if our song is busy if it's
9:04:15
still playing then we will call the time modules sleep method and sleep for 1
9:04:21
second once the song finishes or we terminate the program prematurely the
9:04:27
sound file will no longer be busy so this should be the finished product
9:04:32
let's test it i will set the alarm for
9:04:39
952 and we just have to give it some time
9:04:49
[Music]
64.multithreading
9:05:03
so uh yeah I'm going to talk about multi-threading in Python today multi-threading is used to perform
9:05:09
multiple tasks concurrently think of it like we're multitasking we're performing
9:05:14
a few different actions at once for example I could study and listen to music and eat something at the same time
9:05:21
multi-threading is good for IO bound tasks io meaning input output such as
9:05:27
reading files or fetching data from an API things that may take some time to do and we don't know when it's going to end
9:05:33
exactly to use multi-threading we'll import the threading module import
9:05:41
threading we access the threading module then call the thread constructor and
9:05:46
pass in a target function what we'll do for this demonstration let's say we have a bunch of chores to do we have to walk
9:05:53
the dog get the mail and take out the trash let's define some functions to handle that we have a function to walk
9:06:00
the dog then I will print the following message you finish walking the dog
9:06:12
let's create a function to take out
9:06:19
trash then we will print you take out the
9:06:27
trash then another function of get mail as in get the mail from the
9:06:34
mailbox then I will print you get the mail
9:06:42
just to simulate these functions taking an indeterminate amount of time I'm going to import the time module to help
9:06:50
us let's say walking the dog takes 8 seconds i will access the time module
9:06:59
call the sleep method and pass in 8 for 8 seconds
9:07:04
when we call the walk dog function we'll wait around for 8 seconds then finish walking the dog this chore will take
9:07:11
quite a bit of time to complete taking out the trash it's fairly
9:07:17
quick taking out the trash will take 2 seconds getting the mail will take 4
9:07:26
seconds let's call these functions and see what happens we will begin by
9:07:31
walking the dog i will call the walk dog function followed by take out trash
9:07:42
function and the get mail function here's the
9:07:48
result we're going to wait around for 8 seconds until the walk dog function is
9:07:54
complete right about now you finish walking the dog you take
9:08:00
out the trash and you get the
9:08:05
mail these functions are running on the same thread the main thread our main Python program we have to complete these
9:08:12
chores in order one by one because they're all running on the same thread
9:08:18
instead of walking the dog and then when we're done taking out the trash and then when that's done we get the mail we
9:08:25
could accomplish all three tasks at the same time let's say we have a thread object
9:08:31
we could say thread one or to be more descriptive let's say we have chore one let me zoom in a little
9:08:39
bit chore one is going to contain a thread we will access the threading
9:08:46
module call the constructor for a thread we have to pass in a keyword argument of
9:08:52
target what is the first chore that we have to do let's walk the dog
9:08:58
to start this thread we will take our thread object of chore one and call the start method to start
9:09:05
it okay let's do this with chore 2 access the threading
9:09:13
module call the thread constructor pass in a target then the name of a function take
9:09:20
out trash chore 2 start and then we have chore three i'll
9:09:28
just copy what we have because I'm feeling lazy chore three will be get
9:09:35
mail here's the result now we finish taking out the trash first
9:09:43
then we get the mail then we finish walking the dog so
9:09:49
we're executing these functions concurrently we're multitasking we're taking out the trash and getting the
9:09:56
mail and walking the dog all at the same time one thing that I did want to point
9:10:01
out notice how we finish taking out the trash first followed by getting the mail
9:10:06
then walking the dog these tasks finished in a different order compared to when we weren't multi-threading
9:10:13
that's because taking out the trash finished first it took 2 seconds getting the mail took 4 seconds and walking the
9:10:20
dog took the longest it took 8 seconds previously we finished walking the dog
9:10:25
first then took out the trash then got the mail when all the chores are complete I would like to print a message
9:10:32
i will print the following all chores are
9:10:39
complete here's what happens currently we get this message that all
9:10:44
chores are complete but we haven't finished any yet we're still completing them
9:10:51
there may be at times you want your program to wait for all threads to
9:10:56
finish before we print that confirmation message that all chores are complete
9:11:01
we're going to use the join method take each thread use the join
9:11:08
method we'll do this with chore 2 and chore 3 as well with the join method we will wait
9:11:16
for these threads to finish before continuing with the rest of the program here's the result
9:11:22
now you take out the trash you get the
9:11:29
mail and you finish walking the dog all chores are complete when constructing a
9:11:35
thread object and we have a keyword argument of target if some of these functions take parameters for example
9:11:42
with the function of walk dog let's say we have a first name I will convert this
9:11:47
print statement to an fstring we will display first for the
9:11:53
first name you finish walking whatever your dog's name
9:11:58
is so when we're creating a thread and the target is that function and that
9:12:03
function accepts arguments we need one more keyword argument and that is args
9:12:09
we will send this function a tpple we need a set of parenthesis within this
9:12:14
tpple we will list our arguments let's say that our dog's first name is Scooby
9:12:21
now since this is a tpple if we only have one argument we have to end that tpple with a comma to let Python know
9:12:28
that this is a tpple here's the result you take out the trash you get
9:12:36
the mail you finish walking Scooby all
9:12:43
chores are complete if we were missing this comma this is what would happen we're no
9:12:50
longer passing in a tpple what if we have multiple parameters we have first for first name
9:12:57
and last for last name you finish walking first and
9:13:03
last we have first name of Scooby last name of
9:13:10
do you take out the trash you get the mail
9:13:17
you finish walking Scooby-Doo all chores are complete all right everybody so that is
9:13:24
multi-threading it's used to perform multiple tasks concurrently as if we're
9:13:29
multitasking we're executing multiple functions at the same time multi-threading is good for IO bound
9:13:36
tasks such as reading files or fetching data from APIs and well everybody that
9:13:41
is an introduction to multi-threading in Python hey everybody in this video I'm going to
65.request API data ↩️
9:13:47
show you how we can connect to an API using Python in this demonstration we're going to connect to the Poke API to get
9:13:54
some information on a Pokémon of our choosing i'm assuming that most of us are familiar with Pokémon i thought it'd
9:13:59
be a fun example so according to this API we can look up a Pokémon such as
9:14:05
Pikachu then we can get the stats for Pikachu such as Pikachu's
9:14:13
name height ID number and all sorts of moves and abilities that a Pikachu may
9:14:19
have we will need this URL but we'll handle that
9:14:25
later our first step is that we're going to import the requests library to make
9:14:30
an API request however when I run this I have a module not found error no module
9:14:37
named requests requests is one package we'll have to install it's not normally
9:14:42
included with the standard Python download if I was to go to my project folder go to my virtual environment
9:14:49
library site packages there is no package for requests we'll have to
9:14:54
download that with PyCharm and VS Code there is a built-in terminal that we can use to download the request package we
9:15:02
can use pip pip is a package manager for Python it's normally included when you install Python we'll type pip install
9:15:12
requests it'll take just a second and now we have that package of
9:15:18
requests within our project folder if I run this again that error goes away process
9:15:25
finished with exit code zero that means there were no errors going back to our Pokemon API we
9:15:32
will need this URL let me zoom in so you can see
9:15:40
it i'm going to store that as a base URL so it's easier to work
9:15:46
with for convenience I'm going to create a function name get
9:15:52
Pokemon info to get some info on a Pokemon we'll have to pass in the name of a Pokemon
9:15:59
for now I'll write pass outside of this function let's say we have a variable of
9:16:06
Pokemon name pick a Pokemon i will pick Pikachu for now then
9:16:13
I will call the get Pokemon info function then pass in my Pokemon name remember that your parameters can
9:16:21
be named different than your arguments when you send data to a function you can rename it to something else
9:16:27
temporarily now that we have the name of the Pokémon we would like to look up we can complete the
9:16:32
URL this will be an string so with our Pokemon API we have the base
9:16:40
URL followed by the word Pokemon then the name of a
9:16:45
Pokemon so we have the base URL i'll add a placeholder and insert it forward
9:16:52
slash the word Pokémon slash the name of that
9:16:57
Pokémon in this example it's going to be Pikachu we now have the full URL
9:17:04
we'll access the request module use the get method and pass in that
9:17:10
URL this method is going to return a response object which I will assign to
9:17:16
response response is a response object and I'm just going to print our
9:17:22
response just to see what we're working with here's our response object it has a
9:17:29
status code this is an HTTP status code of 200 200 means the response was
9:17:36
okay here's a few examples of response codes you're probably familiar with 404
9:17:42
not found so we are looking for 200 the
9:17:49
response is okay after we get our response I'll add an if statement
9:17:57
if our response our response object does have an attribute of status code to read
9:18:03
what the status code is if this status code is equal to 200 that means the
9:18:09
response is okay but for now I'll write pass else I'm going to print the
9:18:16
following else I'm going to print failed to retrieve
9:18:24
data and I will print the status code of the response
9:18:30
object so temporarily I will print data retrieved if it was
9:18:39
successful i can't spell okay we have our data data was
9:18:45
retrieved if our status code of our response object is equal to
9:18:50
200 I will take our response object and use the JSON
9:18:56
method our response is a JSON format using this method we'll convert it to a
9:19:01
Python dictionary it will consist of key value pairs much like a JSON file but
9:19:07
I'm going to assign that to a variable of Pokemon data so it's easier to work
9:19:14
with then I will print our Pokemon
9:19:23
data so here's the data on Pikachu it's really difficult to read all
9:19:29
this you can see some keywords we have abilities base experience this is an
9:19:35
extremely large dictionary once we have our dictionary I will
9:19:41
return that dictionary of Pokemon data back to the place where we call this
9:19:47
function and I will store that as a variable pokemon info equals get Pokemon
9:19:55
info pass in a Pokemon's name and now we should have a dictionary
9:20:00
that we can work with let me zoom out
9:20:06
if our dictionary exists we can use the if keyword if Pokemon info if that's true
9:20:13
if it exists this will be true i will print the following i'll use an f
9:20:20
string to access the value of a dictionary we can access it by a key
9:20:25
we'll take our dictionary of Pokémon info access the key of
9:20:31
name let's see what happens exactly we get Pikachu let's get Pikachu's ID
9:20:39
number we will access the key of ID the given value is 25 pikachu is the 25th
9:20:46
Pokémon in the franchise let's get Pikachu's
9:20:55
height pikachu's height is four i don't know what unit of measurement they use in that franchise 4 feet or 4 in i don't
9:21:02
know let's get Pikachu's
9:21:08
weight pikachu's weight is 60 60 lb 60
9:21:13
kg i don't know just to make this look nice I'm going to add
9:21:18
name ID
9:21:24
height and weight that looks much better let's pick
9:21:31
a different Pokemon i will pick my favorite Pokemon of
9:21:39
Tyloian failed to retrieve data does that have to be a lowercase
9:21:45
T yes it does okay so name Tyloian i'll follow the name with the
9:21:52
capitaliz method to make it
9:21:58
capital there we go so my favorite Pokemon is Typhloian id is 157 typhloian's height
9:22:06
is 17 and weight is 795 all right everybody that is one way in which we
9:22:12
can connect to an API using Python also tell me what your favorite Pokémon is in the comment section down
9:22:18
below all right everybody in today's video we're going to get started working with the PIQT5 graphical user interface
66.PyQt5 GUI intro 🖥️
9:22:25
also known as a GUI GUI in this topic we'll be creating a basic window so
9:22:31
let's get started all right the first step is that using pip we're going to install the PIQT5 package open up a
9:22:38
terminal both PyCharm and VS Code have a built-in terminal that you can use we're going to use pip that is
9:22:44
Python's package manager pip install
9:22:50
PIQT5 enter and this might just take a second once your download has finished
9:22:57
you should have a package within your site packages folder named piqt5 we can work with it as long as we
9:23:03
import it first we are going to import the module of CIS cis meaning system this
9:23:11
module provides access to variables used and maintained by the Python interpreter then from the package of pi QT5 do pay
9:23:21
attention to the capitalization it's easy to mess that up use dot to access
9:23:26
the module of QT widgets widgets are the building
9:23:32
blocks of a PIQT5 application they begin with Q that helps distinguish them from
9:23:37
widgets from other libraries they typically begin with Q from this module
9:23:43
import the following widgets q
9:23:48
application and Q main window here's
9:23:54
some boilerplate code that we have to write in order to get this application up and running first we will create a
9:23:59
class of main window which will inherit from the class of Q main
9:24:06
window by inheriting from the parent of Q main window we can customize our own windows to display to the user we will
9:24:14
need a constructor let's define that define innit there will be no
9:24:20
arguments currently besides self and in case we have to pass any arguments to the parent of Q main window we will
9:24:26
access the superass that's the parent and call the parents
9:24:32
constructor but currently we don't have any arguments to pass in we will return to this class
9:24:39
momentarily let's define a function of main when we begin this program we will
9:24:45
call the function of main to begin the application for now I'll write pass
9:24:51
if we are running this file directly let's add the following if statement if
9:24:56
dunder name is equal to a string of dunder main if we are running this file
9:25:03
directly call the main function in order for us to begin if that's true we will call the
9:25:09
function of main within the main function we will create an app object
9:25:15
app equals we will call the constructor for Q application that class but there's
9:25:22
one argument that we have to pass in we will access our module of
9:25:28
cis argv meaning arguments so by passing in
9:25:33
this argument this allows piqt to process any command line arguments intended for it that's if we use command
9:25:40
prompt or terminal we won't be doing that in this series but you may someday in the future it would be a good idea
9:25:45
for us to futureproof our code otherwise you may see people pass in an empty list
9:25:51
so we now have an app object next we will create a window object window
9:25:57
equals call the constructor for our class of main window currently we don't
9:26:02
have any arguments to pass in we have an app object and a window object by calling their respective constructors
9:26:09
now if I run this program currently our window is not going to show the default
9:26:14
behavior for a window is to hide it in order to show our window we will access
9:26:21
our window call the show method to show it it's only going to appear for a brief
9:26:27
second when I run this script i don't know if you saw it but it pops up for a brief second
9:26:35
we need to ensure that the window stays until we interact with it or close it after we show our window we will access
9:26:42
our module of CIS call the exit method the exit method
9:26:49
ensures a clean exit of our program within our exit method we will pass in
9:26:54
as an argument our app object our app object has a built-in method of
9:27:02
exec and this is a method so we can call it this is the execute method there is
9:27:08
an underscore character after exec for execute that distinguishes it from the
9:27:13
execute method there is a separate version of this execute function that ends with an underscore our apps execute
9:27:20
method it waits around for user input and handles events such as if we click buttons press keys or close the window
9:27:28
now that we're calling this method when we run our program this window should stay in place we can maximize it
9:27:36
minimize it or close it that's all the boilerplate code that
9:27:42
we need for a basic window let's customize it within our constructor for our main window what would we like to
9:27:49
add let's set the title for our window self dot set window title method
9:27:59
we will pass in a string think of a title for your program my cool first GUI
9:28:09
guey and now we have a new title my cool first guey graphical user
9:28:15
interface when this window appears we can set the geometry of where the window
9:28:20
appears and the size of the window access self dot set geometry
9:28:29
method there's four arguments x and Y for the X and Y
9:28:34
coordinates a width of the window and a height of the window if I were to set X
9:28:40
and Y to be both zero this window will appear in the top left corner of my screen i'll also need a width and a
9:28:47
height let's say I don't know 500 for
9:28:53
each so now my window is now a square the width and the height are both the
9:28:59
same they're both 500 the width is 500 pixels the height is 500 pixels with the
9:29:05
first two arguments we set the initial placement of our window to be where x is 0 and y is zero that corresponds to the
9:29:12
top left corner if I set the first argument to be 100 well then the window is going to
9:29:20
move to the right by 100 pixels there are ways to center your window in the very center of your screen but that's a
9:29:27
little too advanced for us right now for the time being I'll pick something roughly near the middle of my screen 700
9:29:34
pixels on the xaxis and 300 on the y-axis it should appear roughly in the middle
9:29:40
but feel free to adjust these values based on the size of your screen we'll discuss layouts in the future now if you
9:29:48
would like a window icon we can change that you will need an image to work with
9:29:53
so within my project folder I have a profile picture for my
9:29:59
YouTube channel i'll set that to be the icon find an image that you like then
9:30:04
add it to your project folder in order to work with icons we'll need to make the following import from
9:30:13
piqt5 that's the package access the module of qt
9:30:19
gui import the following Q icon now we
9:30:25
can work with icons after we set the geometry for our
9:30:31
window access this object of self this main window call the method of set
9:30:38
window icon within this method we will call the
9:30:43
constructor of Q icon we'll pass in either a relative file path or an
9:30:49
absolute file path my main Python file is right next to my profile picture that
9:30:55
image i only need the file name within a string so the name of my image it's
9:31:01
going to be different for you depending on what the name of your image is my image is named
9:31:08
profile_pic and this image is a JPEG jpg then when I run this program I'm
9:31:16
using my image as an icon for this window all right everybody that is how
9:31:21
to create a window using PIQT5 and in the next topic we will be creating some
67.PyQt5 labels 🏷️
9:31:27
labels what's up everybody in today's topic we're going to create some labels using
9:31:32
PIQT5 we will import the widget of Q
9:31:37
label this label class is used to create label widgets that can display text or
9:31:43
images within the constructor of our main window this is where we'll create a label we will declare a label object
9:31:51
label equals call the constructor for Q label for the text of the label we'll
9:31:59
pass in a string that's the first argument let's say the word hello for the second argument we will
9:32:06
pass in self self refers to this window object that we're calling and
9:32:12
instantiating all right let's do a test run here is my label although you can
9:32:19
barely see it the font is really small but it does say hello let's set the font we'll need
9:32:26
another import from pi
9:32:31
qt5 dot qt
9:32:36
gui import q font by importing the qfont class we can
9:32:44
begin working with fonts we're going to take our label call the set font
9:32:51
method within this method we will call the constructor of Q
9:32:56
font pick a font that you would like i will pick Ariel but feel free to choose
9:33:02
really any font then the second argument is a font size i'll pick
9:33:08
30 let's do another test run that's much better
9:33:14
let's increase this to 40 for the font size now I'm going to set the geometry
9:33:20
of this label such as the positioning and the width and the
9:33:26
height let's take our label use the set geometry method we
9:33:33
will pass in X and Y coordinates 0 corresponds to the top left corner for
9:33:40
the width let's set the width to be 500 and the height to be 100 that's better i'll cover more
9:33:48
advanced alignments momentarily let's add a stylesheet piqt does have styles that
9:33:55
are very similar to CSS if you would like to learn more about CSS I do have a full course on that topic we will add
9:34:01
some CSS like properties by accessing our label object call the method of set
9:34:09
style sheet within this method we will pass in
9:34:15
some CSS like properties such as a color for the color let's say blue these
9:34:22
CSS like properties should end with a semicolon and now the font color is blue
9:34:29
you could also use RGB values or hexodimal values you could always look up a color picker
9:34:36
and pick a very specific color let's pick something
9:34:42
green we can either use RGB values or hexodimal values so I will copy this
9:34:51
value so I will paste that hexodimal value and now we have a very specific
9:34:57
shade of green but I think I'll go with something dark
9:35:03
such as that so this color is going to be a dark
9:35:10
gray color we could set a background color this will be a new
9:35:18
string background dash color and I will pick a new
9:35:24
color i will pick something blue
9:35:32
that's a decent color we have a blue background with
9:35:39
dark gray text we can set the font to be bold font
9:35:45
weight will be bold so the font is now
9:35:52
bold the font style can be italic font
9:35:57
style italic so our font is italic and we can
9:36:05
underline text decoration
9:36:12
underline the text on our label is now underlined let's work on positioning
9:36:17
next currently my text is left justified and set to the center vertically
9:36:24
to work with alignments we need this import from
9:36:30
piqt5 QT core import
9:36:37
QT the class of QT is used for alignments to center the text of our
9:36:44
label at the top vertically we will take our label use the set alignment
9:36:51
method then pass in a flag access the class of Qot access the flag of align
9:37:00
top this will align our text vertically to the top
9:37:08
so then our text is aligned vertically to the top rather than the center for
9:37:14
the bottom we will use the flag of align
9:37:23
bottom we will align vertically on the bottom the text is now on the
9:37:30
bottom to align vertically in the center align V
9:37:38
center this will be vertically center which it was
9:37:44
originally now for horizontal alignment we can add the following okay to align right we will
9:37:52
pass in a flag of align right
9:37:59
horizontally align right the text is now all the way to the
9:38:08
right for the center align H h for
9:38:14
horizontal center the text is now horizontally
9:38:20
aligned in the center for the
9:38:30
left align
9:38:36
left the text will be aligned to the left we could combine both horizontal
9:38:42
and vertical positioning here's how take our label
9:38:48
call the set alignment method we will align horizontally in the center
9:38:55
follow this with the or bitwise operator which is a vertical bar this allows us
9:39:01
to combine flags we will align horizontally in the center then vertically let's align to the
9:39:09
top so our text should be aligned horizontally we're aligned in the center
9:39:14
and vertically we're aligned to the top align bottom
9:39:23
vertically horizontally we are in the center vertically we're aligned on the bottom then for the very center of our
9:39:37
label align horizontal center and align vertical
9:39:45
center our text will now be in the very middle
9:39:52
of our label both horizontally and vertically now there is a shortcut for
9:39:57
the very center we don't need both of these flags the shortcut is the
9:40:04
following set alignment align
9:40:10
center that will align the text both horizontally and vertically so that is center and center
9:40:18
all right everybody so that is an introduction to labels in PIQT5 what is going on everybody in
68.PyQt5 images
9:40:25
today's video I'm going to show you how we can add images to PIQT5 you will need an image to work
9:40:30
with me i'll be using my profile picture for my YouTube channel feel free to take a moment to find a picture of your own
9:40:37
maybe a profile picture of yourself we will need the following imports q label
9:40:43
the most common and straightforward approach to displaying an image is to add an image to a label in order to
9:40:49
display it then we will need this other import from
9:40:54
piqt5 that's the package then the module of qt gui import the class of
9:41:03
qpix map the class of qpix map it's used for handling images and provides
9:41:10
functionality for loading manipulating and displaying images we will load our image to a qixmap object then add this
9:41:18
qpix mapap object to a label in order to display it within our constructor of our
9:41:23
main window we will create a label label equals call the Q label
9:41:30
constructor then pass in self self refers to the window object our window
9:41:36
will be the parent widget our label widget is one of its children once we have our label we'll set the geometry of
9:41:43
the label label set geometry method we have to pass in x and y coordinates as
9:41:51
well as a width and height of the label for the coordinates let's say zero for
9:41:57
each the label will appear in the top left corner for the width 250 is good
9:42:03
and the height 250 as well here's my window the label is going
9:42:08
to appear in the top left corner however there's nothing added to the label that's where the widget of qpix map
9:42:15
comes in we will create a pix map object equals call the constructor of q pix
9:42:23
mapap we have to pass in a string that represents a relative file path or an absolute file path to our image my image
9:42:31
is right next to my main Python file i just need the file name the name of my image is
9:42:38
profile_pic and this is a JPEG when I run this we don't see our
9:42:44
image we have to add the pixmap object to the label we have to set it here's
9:42:50
how take our label use the set pixmap
9:42:55
method and pass in our pix map object and now we can see the image however the
9:43:02
image doesn't scale according to the size of the label to enable that we have
9:43:07
to call the following method take our label call the set
9:43:13
scaled contents method then pass in true our image will now scale to the size of
9:43:20
the label if we were to change the size of the label let's say it's 100
9:43:28
pixels it will scale down even further or I could even increase it to
9:43:34
500 so now the image takes up the entire width and height of the window let's set that back to
9:43:44
250 there's a few tricks that we can do with positioning of the image we've set our label with an image we can move the
9:43:51
label within the confines of the window currently it's set in the top left corner but here's a few tricks that we
9:43:58
can do with positioning with our label we will set the geometry
9:44:05
again so the top left corner is 0 0 for the coordinates we could pass in 250 and 250
9:44:13
again for the width and the height but if we were to change that here when we
9:44:18
initially create this label we would have to manually change that here as well i think it would be better if we
9:44:24
were to get the current width and height of the label take our label call the width method to get the width same thing
9:44:31
applies with the height label height method and that should work
9:44:38
fine let's say we would like to take our image and move it to the right side of our window here's how with the
9:44:47
x-coordinate we're going to access self that means our window called the width
9:44:54
method here's what we have currently we can't see the label it was placed outside of the
9:45:00
confines of the window let's subtract our label's
9:45:06
width label.width i'll put each of these arguments on a new line just to help
9:45:12
with readability so now our image is right justified
9:45:18
within our window for the bottom right corner we will take the second
9:45:25
argument access self.height that's the height of the window that we're
9:45:31
instantiating minus our labels height and now our image is in the
9:45:38
bottom right corner for the bottom left corner we will set X to be
9:45:46
zero now here's the tricky part to have our image placed in the center of our
9:45:51
window we will take the width of the window minus the width of the label
9:45:57
divided by two for integer division we'll be using double forward slashes we
9:46:03
need our pixels to be whole integers so we're going to be using integer division and not standard division
9:46:09
we will round to the nearest whole pixel then we will do this with the height as
9:46:17
well and now our image should be in the middle of our window all right everybody and that is
9:46:24
how to add an image to your PIQT5 application well hello again friends
69.PyQt5 layout managers
9:46:30
today I got to explain layouts in PIQT5 we'll discuss vertical horizontal and
9:46:35
grid layouts but we'll need the following imports we will be importing Q
9:46:41
label Q widget i'm going to put these imports on a new line just because we have a
9:46:49
lot q V for vertical box
9:46:55
layout and I'm just going to copy this q H for horizontal box
9:47:02
layout and Q grid layout let's be sure that we have all these
9:47:09
imports these classes deal with layout managers they aren't widgets we'll be
9:47:14
writing a majority of the code within our main window class however it can get disorganized really quick what will help
9:47:21
keep things organized is if we declare a separate function within the main window class this is a common practice that
9:47:28
you'll see within PIQT5 there will be a function for init for initialize UI for
9:47:34
user interface no other arguments besides self and for now I'll write
9:47:40
pass when we construct a window object we will call self dot init UI to
9:47:48
initialize the user interface so anything that deals with the user interface we're going to be
9:47:54
writing within this function to help keep our code clean and organized normally we can't add a layout manager
9:48:00
to a main window object main window widgets have a specific design and
9:48:05
layout structure that's normally incompatible with layout managers what we would need to do is create a generic
9:48:12
widget add a layout manager to that widget then add that widget to the main
9:48:17
window in order to display the layout within our method to initialize our user interface we are going to create what is
9:48:24
called a central widget called the constructor for Q
9:48:30
widget this is a generic widget then we will take self self is our
9:48:38
window call the set central widget method then pass in
9:48:45
our central widget when working with layout managers we will add that layout manager to the
9:48:52
central widget the central widget is then added to the main window
9:48:58
so currently this is what we're working with we will need some widgets to organize because right now it's
9:49:05
empty let's create a few labels let's say label 1 equals Q
9:49:12
label i'll pass in some text number one okay let's create four additional labels
9:49:19
1 through 5 i'll just do some copying and pasting
9:49:28
all of our labels are overlapping let's add some colors let's
9:49:34
take label one use the set stylesheet
9:49:39
method then pass in a background color as a CSS property background dash color will be
9:49:49
red let's copy this line of code paste it four additional times for labels 1
9:49:56
through 5 we'll have a label that is yellow
9:50:02
another that is green blue then
9:50:11
purple here are the labels they're all overlapping one another that's why we can only see
9:50:17
five this is where a layout manager comes in we'll start with the vertical layout we
9:50:24
will create a vertical layout manager which we will name vbox vbox equals call the constructor
9:50:32
for QV box layout we are calling the
9:50:38
constructor we will take our layout manager call the add widget method then
9:50:46
pass in a widget such as label one near the top here we'll do this with the other labels
9:50:54
we'll do some copying and pasting add label 2 3 4 and
9:51:01
five there's one last step
9:51:06
we will take our central widget which we have declared at the top of this
9:51:12
function call the set layout method we are setting the layout of our
9:51:18
central widget with the layout manager of Vbox vertical box here's the new layout all
9:51:26
of our labels all of our widgets are arranged vertically for horizontal we
9:51:32
will use QH box layout for horizontal replace any instance of Vbox
9:51:38
with Hbox for the set layout method pass in
9:51:46
Hbox this allows for a horizontal layout then we have
9:51:52
grid q grid layout replace Hbox with
9:52:02
grid so what we have to do with grids after adding a widget we have to specify
9:52:08
a row and column with separate arguments the row and column both begin with zero
9:52:13
so row one column 1 would be row 0 column 0 for label two let's say row 0
9:52:22
column 1 label three will be row 1 column 0
9:52:29
four will be row one column 1 then five row one column 2 so here's the current
9:52:38
layout we have labels 1 and two both within row zero labels 3 4 and 5 are
9:52:44
both within the second row let's say label 5 is row 2 column 2 that would
9:52:51
result with something like this we have label five which is purple in row two
9:52:57
column 2 so it depends on how you want to arrange your widgets all right everybody so that is an introduction to
9:53:04
layout managers in PIQT5 today I'm going to show you how we can create push button widgets in PIQT5
70.PyQt5 buttons 🛎️
9:53:12
to begin we will need the following imports q push button as well as Q label
9:53:19
for this demonstration during the previous topic on layout managers within our constructor for our
9:53:25
main window we defined a method of initialize UI for user interface let's
9:53:31
be sure that we're calling that method within our constructor within this method is where we'll be handling managing the user interface to create a
9:53:38
button we will call the push button constructor normally when creating widgets we would want to prefix that
9:53:44
widget with self then follow the name of the widget for example button however
9:53:50
I'm going to demonstrate what happens when we don't do that because without self we're declaring a local variable
9:53:57
we'll get back to that in just a moment let's create a local button object by calling the Q push button
9:54:04
constructor we can pass in some text such as click me we will add this to our window self
9:54:12
self refers to our window object let's set the geometry of the button button set
9:54:21
geometry we could use a layout manager but I do want to keep this lesson as simple as possible so let's pick some
9:54:27
coordinates i've picked the following for the X and Y coordinates 150 and 200
9:54:33
for the width 200 and the height 100 here's our button currently the font is
9:54:39
a little small so I'm going to set the stylesheet set style sheet
9:54:48
i'll just increase the font size we could use Q font but that might be overkill for this
9:54:54
demonstration let's just say the font size will be 30 pixels now we can read it so we have our
9:55:02
button we're going to be connecting our button to a function but we need to define that function we'll do so within
9:55:09
our main window class so we will define a function of on
9:55:15
click there are no parameters besides self when we click on the button what
9:55:21
would we like to do let's print a test message let's say button clicked and
9:55:28
that's it when we click this button nothing
9:55:34
happens we have to set up a signal and slot for the button here's how
9:55:41
we will take our button dot list a signal a signal is emitted when a widget
9:55:48
is interacted with we have to list the type of signal so the signal we're looking for is
9:55:54
clicked when we click this button we will perform a slot an action we will
9:56:01
take the signal of clicked connect it to a slot connect is a method
9:56:07
the slot will be self dot the name of the method on
9:56:13
click when we press this button we perform this slot this method of on
9:56:20
click each time I press the button we perform that action not only should we print a
9:56:27
message for this demonstration let's set the text of the button so we have
9:56:33
button set text let's change the text
9:56:39
to clicked so this actually isn't going to work because we're not prefixing self
9:56:47
let me demonstrate what happens we print button clicked but then
9:56:53
we have a problem we have an exit code our program was interrupted button is considered local
9:57:00
to our initializer method our on click function doesn't recognize what our button is that's why we're going to
9:57:06
prefix our button with self so it belongs to the class of main window and
9:57:11
not this method any instance of button we're going to prefix with
9:57:18
self and now this should work the text on my button is going to change when I click it clicked
9:57:28
you don't have to do this but with my personal coding style whenever I create a variable or an object within a class I
9:57:36
like to do so within the constructor even PyCharm is giving me a
9:57:41
warning when we declare this button I'm going to move it to the
9:57:47
constructor and let me just rearrange everything self dotbutton equals a Q
9:57:55
push button widget within my initializer method that's when I like to rearrange everything and style it we can also
9:58:03
disable buttons when we click on them to do that we will take
9:58:09
self.button call the set disabled method then pass in true when I click the
9:58:16
button it will be disabled i can no longer click on it
9:58:22
for the last part of this demonstration when we click on our button let's change the text of a
9:58:29
label let's declare self label within our constructor equals a Q
9:58:36
label the text of the label will be hello we will add this label to self the
9:58:43
window when we set up the user interface let's set the geometry of the
9:58:48
label self.l lab set
9:58:53
geometry we could use a layout manager but just to keep things simple I'm going to set some coordinates 150 for X 300
9:59:02
for Y the width will be 200 and the height 100 let's change the font
9:59:09
size self.label set style
9:59:15
sheet i will set the font size to be 30
9:59:22
maybe 50 better all right within our on click
9:59:28
function let's instead take self.label set text method then pass in
9:59:37
some new text to display we're saying hello but when we click the button let's
9:59:43
say goodbye so now when I click the button we will
9:59:49
change the text on a separate widget my label which now says goodbye so with buttons you need a
9:59:57
signal that's connected to a slot the signal is an event the slot is an action
10:00:02
that this widget is going to take when this signal occurs and well everybody
10:00:08
that is an introduction to push buttons in piqt5 hey y so today I got to explain a
71.PyQt5 checkboxes
10:00:14
checkboxes in piqt5 to work with checkboxes we will need the following
10:00:19
import from the module of widgets from piqt5 import q
10:00:27
checkbox to work with different states we will also need the following import
10:00:33
from piqt5qt core importqt
10:00:41
this module of QT core it contains non-geuey classes relevant to piqt5
10:00:47
applications so be sure that you get this import as well to create a checkbox I will create this within the
10:00:54
constructor of my main window we will create a checkbox with self the name of
10:00:59
the checkbox which I will name checkbox equals call the constructor of the Q
10:01:06
checkbox class the first argument is going to be the text of the checkbox
10:01:12
what do you want the checkbox to say let's ask do you like
10:01:19
food the second argument is the parent widget where we will be adding this checkbox let's say self self will apply
10:01:27
to this window we could use a layout manager but I want to keep this lesson as simple as possible we're just going
10:01:33
to focus on checkboxes and their functionality so we should have a checkbox however we can barely see it
10:01:41
the font is really small i have a method to initialize the user
10:01:46
interface that's where we'll set the stylesheet and the geometry of our checkbox let's set the stylesheet self
10:01:54
dot the name of the checkbox checkbox dot set style sheet method then
10:02:03
we can pass in some CSS like properties let's set the font size to be 30
10:02:11
pixels and I will pick a font family font family
10:02:20
Ariel oh and we should change the geometry of the label it's getting cut
10:02:26
off self dot the name of the checkbox which is checkbox
10:02:33
let's set the geometry pass in some X and Y coordinates for the placement as well as
10:02:40
a width and a height i will pick 500 and
10:02:45
100 maybe I'll move it a little more to the right by 10 pixels that's pretty good our checkbox
10:02:54
has an initial state it's normally unchecked that's the default behavior
10:02:59
but we could set that to be checked with the following method when the window loads let's take our checkbox
10:03:07
self.checkbox call the set checked method then pass in true so then when
10:03:14
the window loads the checkbox is already checked but let's keep that as
10:03:21
false now this checkbox it doesn't do anything when I check it let's add some
10:03:28
functionality we'll take our checkbox connect a signal to a
10:03:33
slot the slot can be a function or a method let's define a method within our
10:03:39
main window class let's name this method checkbox changed we will call this
10:03:47
method when the state of our checkbox changes there is one parameter beside
10:03:52
self a state now the state parameter is going to be provided to us when we
10:03:58
interact with our checkbox when we check the checkbox let's print something like a test
10:04:04
message you like food we have to connect a signal of
10:04:10
state changed to a slot of checkbox changed we will take self dot the name
10:04:17
of the checkbox which is checkbox the signal will be state
10:04:23
changed to connect a slot to a signal we use the connect method then pass in a function
10:04:30
or method name so we are working with methods this method belongs to the
10:04:36
window class we'll prefix the method name with self self.checkbox
10:04:44
changed so when I run this program when I check the checkbox we execute this
10:04:49
method you like food now when I uncheck it I instead would like to display you
10:04:55
do not like food so that's where our state is going to come in i'm going to print our state
10:05:03
just to see what it is our state is going to be a
10:05:10
value when we check the check box our state has a value of two when we uncheck
10:05:16
it it has a value of zero zero means unchecked two means checked there's also
10:05:23
one for partially checked but that's not going to be relevant to this topic so
10:05:28
zero or two we could add an if statement such as if state is equal to two then
10:05:35
print you like food however that's not really readable other developers looking
10:05:40
over your code aren't going to understand what two is by looking at it instead let's use the following we will
10:05:46
access the class of QT there's a built-in constant of
10:05:54
checked this also equals to but it's more readable it's a constant so if
10:06:00
state is equal to QT checked print you like food i will check the checkbox you like
10:06:08
food when I uncheck it nothing happens let's add an else statement
10:06:15
else let's print you do not like
10:06:21
food so then when I check the check box we print you like food when I uncheck it
10:06:28
we print you do not like food you like food you do not like food you like food
10:06:34
you do not like food all right everybody so that is an introduction to checkboxes in
10:06:41
PIQT5 all right let's do this thing today I got to talk about radio buttons in PIQT5 to work with radio buttons we
72.PyQt5 radio buttons
10:06:49
will need the following imports from the module of QT widgets we will need the
10:06:54
class of Q radio button as well as Q
10:07:00
button group to group together different buttons let's create three radio buttons
10:07:06
within the constructor of my main window we will construct three radio buttons
10:07:12
for the first radio button this will be named radio one we will call the constructor of the class Q radio button
10:07:20
then we can pass in some text what is the radio button going to say let's say that we're working with payment options
10:07:28
let's say visa for the first option then for the second argument I will pass in
10:07:33
self we will add this radio button directly to our window that would be self let's create two more additional
10:07:40
radio buttons radio 2 and radio 3 the text of radio button two will be
10:07:47
masterard and three will be a gift card we are selecting different payment
10:07:54
options we need to set the geometry of these radio buttons because we're not using a layout manager i have a method
10:08:01
to initialize my user interface this is where I will set the geometry of my radio buttons so let's say
10:08:09
self.radio 1 we will call the set geometry method pass in some coordinates
10:08:16
0 0 is good that applies to the top left corner of my window for the width 300
10:08:22
and the height 50 is good let's do this with radio buttons two and three radio 2
10:08:29
radio 3 we'll just move each radio button down on the y-axis by 50 pixels
10:08:34
each so 50 then 100 here are the three radio buttons however
10:08:41
the font is kind of small we can barely see it so let's apply a stylesheet here's a trick that we can do
10:08:48
with stylesheets we can apply multiple CSS like properties to an entire group
10:08:54
of widgets rather than having to type them and apply them individually we will select our window of self set the
10:09:02
stylesheet of our window with the set stylesheet method we will add a selector the
10:09:09
selector is going to be the name of the widget q radio button in this case then
10:09:15
add a set of curly braces we can apply CSS like properties
10:09:22
to an entire group of widgets this way so let's set the font size of all radio
10:09:28
buttons to be 40 pixels
10:09:34
better let's set the font family to be
10:09:39
aerial then I will add a little bit of padding around each radio button padding 10
10:09:49
pixels that's pretty good so with radio buttons we can only select one from any
10:09:55
one radio button group if I was making a payment I can't pay with a Visa and a
10:10:00
Mastercard at the same time i can only select one option that's the point of radio buttons we're limited to just one
10:10:08
option with the default behavior of PIQT5 all radio buttons unless
10:10:14
explicitly stated are all part of the same group to demonstrate that let's
10:10:19
create two additional radio buttons radio 4 and radio 5 radio button four
10:10:25
will be for a payment method rather than a payment type for example we could say we're paying in
10:10:33
store radio button five will be we're paying online radio buttons 1 through 3
10:10:39
will be for the payment type radio buttons four and five will be for the payment method we're either paying in
10:10:45
store or we're ordering something online we do need to set the geometry for these
10:10:50
two radio buttons i'll just copy these two lines add radio 4 radio 5 we'll set the
10:10:58
y-coordinate of four to be 150 and five to be 200 all radio buttons will be
10:11:06
within the same button group if I was to select in store we deselect one of these options what I would like is one option
10:11:13
from this first group and another option from this other group these buttons are all in the same group i can only select
10:11:20
one if I would like to pay with the visa in store and I click the in store radio
10:11:26
button we unselect the radio button for visa i would like these radio buttons
10:11:32
within different groups we need to create two different groups and add them accordingly here's
10:11:39
how within our constructor we will access self declare a button group let's
10:11:46
name it button group one for simplicity equals call the constructor of the class
10:11:52
Q button group then pass in self to set the parent widget to be the
10:11:58
window then we will create button group
10:12:03
two we're going to access self select the radio button
10:12:08
group button group one call the add
10:12:14
button method then pass in a radio button self.radio
10:12:21
one then we'll add radio 2 and radio
10:12:26
3 we'll select button group two this time button group
10:12:32
two add radio button four and radio button
10:12:38
five the first three radio buttons are within the same group radio buttons four and five are within a different group we
10:12:45
can only select one radio button from any one radio button group maybe I would like to pay with a
10:12:52
Visa card in store or a master card online or a gift card in store these
10:12:59
radio buttons are within different button groups we're limited to one selection in any one radio button group
10:13:06
when we select these radio buttons they don't quite do anything for each radio button we have to connect a signal to a
10:13:13
slot here's how let's define a method of
10:13:19
radio button changed there will be no parameters besides
10:13:25
self temporarily i'll write pass we'll fill this in in a
10:13:30
moment we will take each radio button let's start with radio one radio one the
10:13:37
signal will be toggled when this radio button is toggled we will connect a slot
10:13:45
we will pass in a function or a method self radio button changed then we will
10:13:53
do this with the other radio buttons 1 through
10:14:01
5 let's print a test message you selected
10:14:07
something just to be sure that everything is working you selected
10:14:13
something okay we know that that works
10:14:18
currently what we're going to need to do is get the sender widget which radio
10:14:24
button sent the signal of toggled i will create a local radio
10:14:30
button to store that radio button whichever one emitted the signal we can
10:14:36
determine that with selfender method the sender method is
10:14:41
going to return the widget that sent the signal so if we select radio button one
10:14:47
our radio button will be radio button one if it was five then it's five in
10:14:52
this case then we'll determine if our radio button is checked take our radio button use the
10:15:00
is checked method this will return a boolean true or false if it's checked if
10:15:07
this returns true then let's print the following i'll use an fring we will get
10:15:14
the text of the radio button radio button call the text method to return
10:15:20
the text of the radio button is selected all right then let's see if
10:15:27
this works let's select Visa visa is selected
10:15:33
Mastercard is selected gift card is selected in store is selected and online
10:15:39
is selected that's how to determine which radio button was selected which one is
10:15:45
the sender which one sent the signal all right everybody so that is an
10:15:50
introduction to radio buttons in PIQT5 why hello everybody today I got to
73.PyQt5 line edits
10:15:57
explain lineedit widgets in PIQT5 also known as text boxes in pretty much
10:16:03
anything ever made ever why are they called lineedit widgets i really don't know let's begin from the module of QT
10:16:10
widgets we will import the following class of Q
10:16:16
lineedit to create a text box i mean a line edit widget we are accessing our window of
10:16:23
self we will call this line ededit widget
10:16:29
lineedit equals call the constructor of the class q
10:16:35
lineedit then we will pass in self to add this lineedit widget to the
10:16:42
window let's set the geometry but we do have a text box in which we can type in stuff
10:16:49
i have a method to initialize the user interface within this method I will
10:16:55
access self dot the line edit widget and set the
10:17:03
geometry let's set it in the top left corner where X is 10 Y is 10 set a width
10:17:09
200 is good and a height 40 that's not too bad now the text is
10:17:17
really small we can change that by applying a stylesheet access our window with self
10:17:25
access our line edit widget then call the set stylesheet
10:17:32
method we can pass in some CSS like properties including a font
10:17:38
size let's pick 25 pixels
10:17:44
and here's my new text box we can read the text now let's also change the font
10:17:51
family font family I will pick
10:17:56
Ariel this text box by itself it really doesn't do anything we need some way to
10:18:02
get the text from the text box let's add a button when we click on the button we
10:18:08
will get the text from the text box and do something with it because right now it doesn't do
10:18:14
anything we will need to import Q push
10:18:19
button let's create one button self.button equals call the constructor
10:18:26
of the class q push button let's say that this is a submit
10:18:31
button i will pass in a string of submit and we are adding this button to our
10:18:38
window and we do need to set the geometry of the button we're not using a
10:18:44
layout manager right now access our window with self access
10:18:49
our button that we have previously created in our constructor then call the set geometry
10:18:57
method we'll place our button where X is 210 Y is 10 the width will be
10:19:05
100 and the height will be 40 not too bad let's change the font
10:19:11
size of the button i'll copy these two lines of code because I'm
10:19:16
lazy instead of selecting our line edit widget we will select our
10:19:24
button that's better if I were to click on the button it doesn't do
10:19:29
anything we'll set up the signal of clicked to connect to a method that will do
10:19:36
something let's define a method of submit we're submitting something we're
10:19:42
submitting the text within the text box and for now I'll write pass we'll get back to this in a
10:19:48
second we're going to take our button self.button we'll connect the signal of
10:19:56
clicked clicked dot connect method we will connect the method of submit
10:20:04
self.submit so when we click on the button we will call this method let's print a test
10:20:10
message you clicked the button let's type in
10:20:17
something press submit and we get our test message you clicked the
10:20:24
button let's get the text from the text box then do something with
10:20:29
it let's create a local variable of text text equals now we have to get the text
10:20:37
from our lineedit widget self dot
10:20:42
lineedit that's the widget to get the text we can use the text method to
10:20:47
return the text then let's print the text i'll use an
10:20:53
fstring we'll say hello add a placeholder then display the
10:20:59
text so now after typing in something why don't you type in your name then press submit
10:21:07
we will display hello your name you could add some placeholder text
10:21:13
too let's do that here let's take self do.Eedit line edit
10:21:20
widget set placeholder
10:21:27
text and let's say enter your name when I run this program we have
10:21:34
some placeholder text that says enter your name this time I will type in Spongebob then press submit hello
10:21:43
Spongebob all right everybody so those are lineedit widgets also commonly referred to as text boxes and well
10:21:51
everybody those are lineedit widgets in piqt5 hello everybody so in today's
74.PyQt5 CSS styles
10:21:57
video I'm going to explain setting stylesheets in piqt5 css means cascading
10:22:02
stylesheets if you're not familiar with CSS you can still follow along but knowing CSS is helpful as a reminder I
10:22:10
do have a full free course on YouTube on HTML and CSS if you would like to learn more let's begin for this demonstration
10:22:18
we will need the following imports we will be designing some buttons we will import Q push
10:22:24
button we'll be working with the layout manager we will import Q
10:22:29
widget and for a horizontal layout manager we will need
10:22:35
QH box layout so import these three from
10:22:40
the module of QT widgets now in previous topics we've set the geometry of our
10:22:45
window since we're using a layout manager we don't necessarily need that anymore so I'm going to delete it in the
10:22:52
past I have also created a method to initialize our user interface and we are calling that within the constructor of
10:22:58
our main window we will create three push button widgets self do.button Button one will
10:23:04
be the first button equals take our Q push button class and call the
10:23:10
constructor we can add text to the button we will pass that as an argument now since we're using a layout manager
10:23:16
we don't need to add this button to self our window we don't need to do that
10:23:22
let's create two more buttons we'll have button two and button three button two
10:23:28
will say number two button three will say number three now we'll create a layout manager under normal
10:23:34
circumstances we can't add a layout manager to our main window with main window widgets there's already a
10:23:39
specified layout and format we're going to add a layout manager to a central widget and this widget will be added to
10:23:47
the main window let's take care of that within our initialize user interface method we will create a central
10:23:56
widget equals call the constructor of Q widget then we will take self that means
10:24:04
our window and set the central widget set central widget then pass in
10:24:13
our central widget to set it then we will create a layout we will call the
10:24:18
constructor within the class of qhbox layout let's name this layout hbox for a
10:24:26
horizontal box equals call the constructor within this
10:24:31
class we will take our layout of horizontal box then add the following
10:24:38
widgets add widget self.button one we'll do this with two and three
10:24:49
then the last thing we need to do is take our central widget call the set layout
10:24:56
method then pass in our layout manager and now we should have those three buttons they're all arranged
10:25:04
horizontally now we're going to apply some CSS like styling using the method
10:25:10
of set style sheet here's how rather than apply the CSS properties individually such as self.button button
10:25:17
one set stylesheet and in the past we've passed in individual CSS properties we're
10:25:24
instead going to set the stylesheet of our window self we have a lot to write
10:25:30
instead of double quotes we're going to use triple
10:25:35
quotes triple quotes are used to write very long strings in a more organized
10:25:41
way all of the CSS properties that we're going to write are going to be within this set of triple quotes so let me give
10:25:48
you a demonstration we could individually apply CSS like properties to each of these widgets but we could
10:25:54
select an entire class of widgets too let's select the class of Q push button
10:26:01
then add a set of curly braces the following CSS properties will
10:26:07
apply to all Q push button widgets so currently this is what we have we'll
10:26:13
increase the font size for every push button so we will add the following property of font
10:26:20
size then set it to be 40 pixels each be sure to end each CSS property with a
10:26:27
semicolon so the font size is now 40 for every button let's set the font font family i
10:26:36
will pick Ariel let's add some padding we can add some
10:26:43
space around the text and the button itself so with padding if I was to set
10:26:50
this to 75 pixels we would have 75 pixels worth of
10:26:56
space between the text and the border of the button i would like to change the dimensions of the padding so let's apply
10:27:03
15 pixels to the top and bottom of the button and 75 to the
10:27:09
sides that's better margin is the space around a
10:27:15
button let's set the margin to be 25 pixels now the buttons are more spread
10:27:21
out if this was 250 they would really be spread out that's margin it's the space
10:27:28
around a widget let's set that back to
10:27:34
25 i'm going to change the border border 3 pixels
10:27:42
solid this would change the border of the buttons we now have a black border
10:27:47
that's 3 pixels in width if you would like to round the corners we can use border radius i will set that to be 15
10:27:55
pixels with all the buttons the corners are now rounded within our set stylesheet method we're
10:28:02
applying all of these CSS like properties to every push button now what
10:28:08
if you would like to apply CSS properties to only one widget rather than all of them here's how with each of
10:28:15
our widgets buttons 1 2 and three we need to set an object name let's do that
10:28:21
before we call the set stylesheet method we will take our buttons self.button button
10:28:27
one call the set object name method then
10:28:33
pass in a name for this widget we'll keep the name the same as button
10:28:38
one so let's do this with button two and button three button two button
10:28:46
three within the context of set stylesheet we will refer to these widgets by their object name buttons 1 2
10:28:54
and three and now we can select them individually let's say that with button
10:29:00
one I would like the background color to be red we're going to access our class
10:29:05
of Q push button follow this with a pound sign i like to call it a hashtag
10:29:12
then we need the object name button one button one refers to the widget of
10:29:17
button one again I kept the name the same then we need a set of curly braces
10:29:23
between the set of curly braces we can list one or many different CSS properties let's change the background
10:29:31
color i will set it to be red and now the background color of only
10:29:37
that button is red and not all of them if I was to set the background
10:29:43
color within the class well then all of them would be red okay okay so with button two I'll
10:29:50
just copy what we have and paste it we are selecting the ID of button two
10:29:56
let's set the background color to be green so then the background color is
10:30:02
now green and button three button three will be blue
10:30:13
if you would like a greater variety of colors I recommend looking up a color picker you can just Google color picker
10:30:21
so if I would like a very specific shade of red I can pick that let's go with
10:30:27
that there are a few options provided to you you can use hex
10:30:35
values now we have a very specific shade of red you can use
10:30:44
RGB RGB enclose it within a set of parenthesis and then paste those
10:30:51
numbers or my favorite which is HSL hsl means hue saturation and
10:31:00
lightness we will enclose our values within HSL if you copy these values
10:31:06
directly from Google you would have to remove this degree symbol i like HSL because I can also
10:31:13
control the saturation and the lightness pretty easily okay let's pick a very specific shade of
10:31:20
green that's good i would say I'll use the HSL
10:31:25
values hsl remove the degree
10:31:31
symbol and now we have a very specific shade of green and
10:31:37
blue that's good i would
10:31:49
say that's not too bad if you're already familiar with CSS we can apply pseudo
10:31:55
classes such as when we hover over one of the buttons here's how let's copy
10:32:00
these three blocks then paste them
10:32:06
again we can add CSS properties when we hover over something we have to use the
10:32:12
hover pseudo class after the ID of each of our buttons we will add colon hover
10:32:19
we can apply the following CSS properties when we hover over the buttons all I'm going to do is up the
10:32:26
lightness let's say by 20% each then when we hover over one of the
10:32:33
buttons the lightness is going to change we apply the new CSS
10:32:39
properties all right everybody so that is a more in-depth explanation of the set stylesheet method in
10:32:47
PIQT5 all right everybody in today's video we're going to build a digital clock widget using Python's PIQT5
75.digital clock program
10:32:54
library at the top of our Python file we will need the following imports import
10:33:00
CIS cis means system this module provides variables used and maintained
10:33:05
by the Python interpreter we would also need widgets widgets are the building blocks of a guey application
10:33:12
from the package of pi QT5 we need to access the module of QT
10:33:20
widgets import the following q
10:33:25
application Q widget this is a generic widget we'll turn our digital clock into
10:33:32
its own widget and Q label to work with labels we will be using a layout manager
10:33:39
more specifically QV box
10:33:44
layout there's another import we'll need too from the package of
10:33:49
piqt5 access the module of QT core the QT core module it provides functionality
10:33:56
not related to GUI components this is where we'll get a timer to keep track of the time from this module we will import
10:34:04
Q timer Q time and QT qt is for alignment
10:34:11
we will create a class of digital clock instead of inheriting from the main
10:34:17
window widget we will inherit from the base class of Q widget q widget is a
10:34:23
base class to create our own widgets our digital clock will be a widget we will
10:34:28
need a constructor so let's define that define init pass in self if there are
10:34:35
any arguments to send to the parent we will call the constructor of the parent the superass
10:34:42
super call the init method at the end of the constructor what I like to do is call a method of
10:34:49
initialize UI init UI this will be a separate method define init UI there are
10:34:59
no parameters besides self and for now I'll write pass it's within this method
10:35:04
that we will be designing the layout of the digital clock within the constructor that's where we will be constructing all
10:35:10
of the different entities for the clock at the end of my Python file I will add the following statement if dunder name
10:35:18
is equal to a string of dunder main this statement will be true if we
10:35:25
are running this program directly to create an application we will create an app object equals call
10:35:32
the constructor within the class Q application as an argument to the constructor we will pass in the
10:35:39
following argument access the module of CIS argv which means arguments this
10:35:45
would apply if we're running from command prompt or terminal but we won't be doing that in this video but it's
10:35:51
nice just to set it up in case we do in the future now we are going to create a clock
10:35:57
object clock equals we will call the constructor of our digital clock class
10:36:03
there are no arguments now the window doesn't appear that's because we have to
10:36:08
use the show method of our clock take our clock call the show method now it's
10:36:14
only going to appear for a brief second just momentarily i don't know if you saw that
10:36:21
to ensure a clean and proper exit of our application we need to call the following method access our module of
10:36:28
CIS call the exit method then pass in the following we will take our app
10:36:34
object then call the following method exec underscore and then a set of
10:36:41
parenthesis it's a method it's the execute method it starts the main event loop of the application it also handles
10:36:48
events such as key presses mouse clicks or other user interactions so then we
10:36:54
should have a window that stays in place until we exit okay now we have the base
10:37:00
functionality all set up we have a class of digital clock that inherits from the
10:37:05
Q widget base class we're not going to be using main window in this video within the constructor of my digital
10:37:11
clock I will create a label self dot time label this will be a label that
10:37:18
displays the time we will call the constructor within the class q label
10:37:24
then be sure to pass in self we will be adding this label directly to our widget
10:37:29
of clock we will need a timer self.time timer equals call the constructor of q
10:37:36
timer then pass in self we are adding the timer to the clock now with
10:37:43
designing the layout of our clock I'll handle that within the initialize user interface
10:37:48
method we're going to set a title for the window self set window title method
10:37:57
pass in a string that will be used for the title of the window let's say digital clock then our window should say
10:38:06
digital clock let's set the geometry of the window self set
10:38:14
geometry the first two arguments are going to be for the placement of the window where will it appear within your
10:38:21
screen so I'll pick something approximately in the middle for me but feel free to change these values then we
10:38:27
need a width for the window let's say 300 and a height 100 for the height so
10:38:34
my window should appear approximately in the middle of my screen the base width is 300 the base height is 100 now we're
10:38:41
going to need a layout manager i will name this layout manager VBOX for a
10:38:47
vertical box vbox equals call the constructor within the class
10:38:53
QVbox this will arrange all of our widgets vertically but we only have one widget a time label so we will take our
10:39:02
layout manager of vbox add widget that's a method we will
10:39:09
pass in selftime label as an argument we're adding our label to this layout
10:39:14
manager of vbox then to set the layout we will take self that applies to our clock call the
10:39:23
set layout method then pass in our layout manager of
10:39:28
vbox so currently if I run this we don't see anything temporarily within our
10:39:33
label I will add some text just as a placeholder so we can see what we're working with let's say
10:39:42
12:00 so then we should see something at least although the font is kind of small
10:39:48
we will be getting rid of this later we just want to be sure that we can see everything all right so after our layout
10:39:57
I would like the label to be center aligned horizontally here's how we can set that
10:40:02
up we will take our label self.time label call the set alignment
10:40:13
method access the class of Qot access align
10:40:21
center this should center align our time now let's work on the font i can
10:40:29
barely read it we will take our label
10:40:34
selftime label set style sheet we can pass in
10:40:41
multiple CSS like properties let's set the font size i'll set it to be 150
10:40:49
pixels now we can read it you could pick a font but we're going to
10:40:55
change that at the end of this video we'll import a custom font but temporarily let's say font family
10:41:06
Ariel you could change the color too so if I set the color to be
10:41:13
green then the font color is going to be green but I would like a very specific
10:41:19
shade of green you could always Google a color picker then pick a very specific color
10:41:27
uh let's go with that something that's bright green you can copy the hex value
10:41:33
RGB or HSL hsl means hue saturation and lightness i'll use HSL
10:41:41
values for the color we will type HSL add a set of parenthesis then paste
10:41:47
those values but there is a degree symbol you do have to get rid of that now the font color is going to be bright
10:41:53
green let's change the background color here's how we will take self that
10:42:00
applies to our clock then call the set stylesheet method pass in a background
10:42:08
color we will set the background color property to be
10:42:14
black i think that looks pretty good but it doesn't quite do anything quite yet that's the next step let's create a
10:42:21
method to update time no arguments besides self i will create a local
10:42:28
variable of current time equals now to get the current time we can access the
10:42:35
class of Q time q time dot call the method of
10:42:42
current time we will need to convert it to a string we will method chain the tworing
10:42:49
method within the two-string method we will design the layout of the time so I
10:42:55
would like hours first i will type two h's colon minutes that's 2 m's colon 2
10:43:02
s's to set the text of the label we will take selftime label call the set text method then pass
10:43:11
in our current time so if I run this currently we still have
10:43:17
our placeholder time let's update it with the current time we can get rid of
10:43:23
our placeholder text of 12 we can delete it after we set the font let's call the
10:43:30
method of update time self.update
10:43:36
time now we should display the current time so me I'm recording this video at
10:43:41
7:44 in the morning if you would like to add AM or PM after your time here's
10:43:47
how after our string format specifiers we will add capital A a means anteridium
10:43:55
and P means post meridian so then we should display A.M or P.M depending on when you're coding
10:44:02
this currently the time for me is 7:45 a.m to get the clock to update every
10:44:09
second we need to connect our timer widget to a slot of update time we will
10:44:15
take our timer self.time timer this isn't the time label it's the timer to
10:44:20
keep track of the time during a signal of time out we will connect the
10:44:27
following slot of self.update time
10:44:33
self.update time with our timer we need to trigger a timeout signal every 1,00
10:44:40
milliseconds every second that is to handle that we will take our timer self.time timer call the start method
10:44:48
then pass in 1,00 for 1,00 milliseconds so then when we run this
10:44:55
program our clock should update every second and display the new current time
10:45:01
as an added bonus if you would like to download a custom font here's how using
10:45:06
Google or another search engine I would recommend looking up a font of your choosing so one font that I like is DS
10:45:13
Digital what we need is a TTF file meaning true type font i'll just pick
10:45:20
this first link so these fonts are pretty good so I'm going to download them
10:45:28
i'll pick this specific font DS Digit and again the file extension is
10:45:34
TTF so once you have your font move it to your project folder so for
10:45:39
convenience we have that TTF file right next to our main Python file okay to
10:45:45
work with specific fonts we will need the following import from piqt5
10:45:53
qt gui import Q
10:45:59
font as well as Q font data
10:46:06
base since we're going to use our own custom font we can delete that from the set stylesheet method of our time label
10:46:13
so let's set the font right here we will assign a local variable of font
10:46:20
id equals q font
10:46:25
database q font database is a class for managing and querying fonts available to
10:46:31
the application to add a custom font we will call the following method within it
10:46:36
add application font within the set of quotes we're
10:46:43
going to pass in a file path this can be a relative file path or an absolute file path this TTF file is right next to my
10:46:50
main Python file i only need the file name my font file is named
10:46:56
DS digit and get the file extension of
10:47:01
TTF we will create a local variable of font family we will retrieve the name of the
10:47:09
font family from this ID again we will access Q font database dot call the
10:47:19
application font families method so this method returns a list of font names we
10:47:26
will pass in our font ID but there's another step we're going
10:47:32
to use the index of operator and get the index of zero this will retrieve the
10:47:38
first element of the font family that's because we're working with a list we will need just the first element at
10:47:44
index zero now we'll have a font family to work with now to set the font we will
10:47:51
create a local variable of my font equals call the class call the
10:47:57
constructor within the class Q font pass in the following arguments our
10:48:05
font family that's the first argument and then a font size let's say 150 to
10:48:12
set the font we will take our time label self dot time
10:48:18
label call the set font method then pass in my font our custom
10:48:26
font so then we should have our custom font that digital font that we've
10:48:31
downloaded all right everybody so that is how to create a digital clock widget using
10:48:37
PIQT5 hey yeah everybody so in today's video we're going to create this stopwatch program using Python's PIQT5
76.stopwatch program
10:48:44
library once that's out of the way you will need the following imports import cis cis means system it
10:48:52
handles system variables for your Python interpreter we will need the following widgets from
10:48:58
piqt5 access the module of QT widgets
10:49:04
widgets are the building blocks of a PIQT5 application we will import the following
10:49:10
widgets q application q widget q label q push
10:49:22
button qv box layout and QH box
10:49:29
layout let me put these on a new line just so we can read everything from the package of
10:49:36
PIQT5 access QT core we will import Q timer our timer will emit a
10:49:45
signal after a given interval which is what we need for a stopwatch q time to
10:49:50
keep track of the time and QT for alignment let's do a test run to be sure
10:49:56
that there's no errors looks like L and label should be capital there we go no errors once you
10:50:04
have the following imports we will construct a class a class of
10:50:10
stopwatch which will inherit from the base class of Q widget our stopwatch
10:50:16
will be a widget we will need a constructor we'll define that dunder
10:50:22
init no arguments besides self if we have arguments to pass to the parent of Q
10:50:28
widget we will call the superass the parent call the constructor of the
10:50:33
parent no arguments currently now if we are running this file directly we'll use an if statement
10:50:40
to verify that if dunder name is equal to a string of dunder main if this is
10:50:48
true if we are running this file directly then we will construct a stopwatch we will create an app object
10:50:56
call the constructor within the Q application class pass in the following
10:51:01
access cis our system access argv which means arguments this is if we're using
10:51:09
command line arguments which we won't be using but it's nice to futureroof our code just in case we do in the future we
10:51:16
will create a stopwatch object stopwatch equals call the
10:51:22
constructor within our class of stopwatch our window is not going to show unless we call the show method take
10:51:30
our stopwatch call the show method now our window is only going to show for a
10:51:35
brief second we need to ensure a clean exit we
10:51:40
can access cis call the exit method pass in the
10:51:46
following app then call the exec method this method starts the main
10:51:54
event loop and handles events so then we should have a basic window which stays in place until we
10:52:01
close it we now have the main skeletal structure of a PIQT5 application set up
10:52:06
if you're one of the people that have jumped ahead up until this point we have a class of stopwatch which inherits from
10:52:12
the Q widget class we've constructed a stopwatch object and we're showing it so now we can begin
10:52:19
designing our stopwatch we will create a time object self dot time equals call
10:52:27
the constructor within the class of Q time for arguments we'll pass in the hours minutes seconds and milliseconds
10:52:35
all zero we need a label for the stopwatch self.time
10:52:41
time label equals call the constructor of Q label what would we like the text
10:52:48
to say i'll display some placeholder text a bunch of
10:52:54
zeros 0 hours minutes seconds and milliseconds we will add this label to
10:53:01
self our stopwatch we need a start button self.st
10:53:06
Start button equals call the constructor within Q push button what would we like
10:53:14
the text of the button to say let's say start we are adding this button to self
10:53:20
our stopwatch we need a stop button let's
10:53:26
replace start with stop change the text from start to stop and reset
10:53:34
the name of this button will be the reset button the text will be
10:53:39
reset we will need a timer to emit a signal at a given interval self.time
10:53:46
timer equals call the constructor within the class Q timer then pass in
10:53:54
self we're going to call a method of initialize UI self.init UI
10:54:02
but we still have to define this method all right within our stopwatch class we need the following
10:54:08
methods a method of init UI this is where we'll be designing the user
10:54:15
interface i'll write pass for now as a placeholder we need a method to
10:54:22
start to start the stopwatch that is a method to stop the
10:54:29
stopwatch a method to reset the
10:54:35
stopwatch we'll create a method to format our time format time besides self
10:54:41
there's one parameter we have to pass in a time to format we will be returning a
10:54:47
string a string representation of the current time and a method to update our display
10:54:55
update display here are the six methods we'll
10:55:02
need within our initialize user interface method we will set the title
10:55:07
of the window because right now it says Python we will take self our stopwatch
10:55:14
call the set window title method and we will pass in
10:55:22
stopwatch that should change the title of the window to stopwatch we're going
10:55:27
to use a vertical layout manager for the label and the buttons we will create a layout manager
10:55:34
named VBox vbox equals call the constructor of
10:55:40
QV box layout we will take our layout manager
10:55:46
and add the following widgets self.time
10:55:54
label then our start stop and reset
10:55:59
buttons start button stop
10:56:05
button and reset
10:56:12
button we will take self set the layout pass in our vertical layout
10:56:19
manager so we have all of our buttons we have
10:56:25
our widgets arranged in a column we're going to take our time label and also
10:56:30
center it horizontally we will take our time label self.time
10:56:37
label call the set alignment method access our class of QT
10:56:45
access the flag of align center that's going to center align the
10:56:52
time it should be aligned both vertically and horizontally now with your buttons
10:56:58
they're arranged in a column we could group them together horizontally here's how we will create a
10:57:05
horizontal layout manager of HBox hbox equals call the constructor of QHBOX
10:57:15
layout instead of adding these buttons directly to our vertical layout manager let's cut
10:57:23
them paste them underneath HBox replace Vbox with HBox
10:57:31
then with our vertical layout manager Vbox we will add our layout of
10:57:42
Hbox this group of buttons is arranged vertically with the time
10:57:47
label now we'll be applying a stylesheet access self our stopwatch
10:57:54
call the set style sheet method we can pass in one extremely long string
10:58:01
with a set of triple quotes all of the CSS like properties we'll add will do so
10:58:06
between the set of triple quotes let's select our buttons q push button we are
10:58:13
selecting an entire class within a set of curly braces let's
10:58:19
add the property a font size the font size of all buttons will be 50 pixels
10:58:27
let's customize our label select the class of Q label within a set of curly braces let's
10:58:36
add the following properties font size will be
10:58:42
120 if you would like we can add a background color too to the label we can select a background
10:58:51
color temporarily i will select blue but we can pick more specific shades of blue
10:58:57
or another color here's how you can look up a color picker and
10:59:02
select a very specific color you can use hex values RGB or HSL i've already
10:59:09
selected a color i'm going to copy these HSL values so instead of a color name we
10:59:16
will select HSL then paste those values if you have a degree symbol you will
10:59:22
need to remove that and now we have a very specific shade of blue i will also round the corners of
10:59:29
our label add the property of border radius i will set that to be 20
10:59:37
pixels this will round the corners between each button and label we'll add
10:59:42
some padding we're going to use multiple selectors we will select all push
10:59:49
buttons and all labels apply the following properties to each i
10:59:55
will add padding of 20 pixels around these
11:00:01
widgets and I will also make the font weight
11:00:06
bold font weight will be bold all right I think that looks pretty
11:00:13
good hey this is Bro from the future i am currently editing this video if you would like you can add a font family one
11:00:21
font that I think looks really good is Calibri we'll apply that to all push buttons and Q
11:00:28
labels i really like this font i think it fits a stopwatch but it's up to you if you would like to change the font i
11:00:34
just thought I would mention that now we just have to add some functionality because these buttons don't do
11:00:40
anything for each of our buttons we have to connect a signal to a slot we will
11:00:46
take our start button self start button with the signal of clicked we
11:00:54
will connect the following slot we will call the start method self.st start
11:01:00
method let's do this with the stop button change start to
11:01:06
stop clicked connect self.s stop method
11:01:13
reset self.reset reset button called the reset
11:01:20
method at a given interval we're going to update our
11:01:25
display self.time timer during a signal of
11:01:31
timeout we will connect the following method self.update
11:01:37
display self.update display within our start method we will
11:01:43
take our timer self.time a timer call the start method pass in 10 for 10
11:01:50
milliseconds we will set an interval for a timeout every 10
11:01:57
milliseconds within our stop method we will take our timer and instead call the
11:02:02
stop method we'll get back to reset in just a moment let's work on the format time
11:02:09
method from our time that we pass in we have to get the hours minutes seconds and
11:02:15
milliseconds we will create some local variables hours equals access our time
11:02:21
that we pass in call the hour method to return hours we have variable minutes time dot
11:02:30
call the minute method to return the minutes we have a variable of seconds
11:02:35
seconds seconds equals take our time call the second method then for
11:02:43
milliseconds access our time call the mc which means milliseconds and call it
11:02:51
this is a method i'm going to return a string an string to represent the
11:02:58
time we will add four placeholders hours and milliseconds each
11:03:06
will be separated with a colon except for milliseconds which will be a dot a
11:03:12
period we will display the hours i'll add some leading zeros two
11:03:18
leading zeros let's do this for minutes we're using a format specifier
11:03:25
for two leading zeros as well
11:03:31
seconds and milliseconds
11:03:39
now we will work on the update display method we have to get the time self dot
11:03:45
time equals we will take our time but call the add milliseconds
11:03:53
method mcs then pass in 10 for 10 milliseconds
11:04:01
we're going to take our time label self.time label and set the text of
11:04:09
it we will call our format time method but we have to pass in a time we
11:04:16
will be passing in selftime let's see what we have
11:04:22
currently we can start the stopwatch and we can stop it
11:04:29
however we're displaying three digits for the milliseconds we can eliminate that within format time when we get the
11:04:37
milliseconds we will use integer division we will divide by 10 this will
11:04:44
convert our milliseconds from three digits to two we're basically dividing by
11:04:49
10 so here's our stopwatch currently we can start we can stop we can start again and
11:04:58
we can stop again now we just need to reset here's how within the reset method
11:05:05
we will take our timer self.time timer use the stop method to stop we will
11:05:11
reassign our time call the constructor of Q time we have to pass in hours
11:05:18
minutes seconds and milliseconds they're all going to be zero we're resetting our
11:05:23
time and then we'll reset the text again of our time label self.time label call the set text
11:05:32
method when we set the text we will first format it with the format time
11:05:38
method but we have to pass in a time we will pass in
11:05:44
selftime and now we should be able to reset our stopwatch we can
11:05:50
start we can stop we can reset start again and stop
11:05:58
again all right everybody so that is a cool stopwatch that you can make using
11:06:04
Python hey uh what's going on everybody so in today's video we're going to create a working weather app that
77.weather API app ☀️
11:06:10
fetches real-time weather data from an API this is a massive project so feel
11:06:15
free to take your time take several days or even weeks if you need to complete this heck you can even add this project
11:06:21
to your portfolio well let's get started
11:06:27
everybody all right let's get started everybody this is a fairly useful API to get real-time weather data the website
11:06:34
is openweathermap.org you will need your own API key but signing up for an
11:06:40
account is free to create an account we'll go to sign in create an account enter your
11:06:47
information and then sign in once you're signed in to find your API key go to this drop-own menu go to
11:06:55
my API keys and you would just need to copy this API key if the status is
11:07:01
inactive you'll need to toggle it to active like so now it may take several minutes for
11:07:08
your API key to become active hopefully by the time of this project where we will need it it'll be active i would
11:07:15
either leave up this window or copy this key and paste it somewhere we will need the following
11:07:21
imports we will import CIS cis means system it handles system variables for
11:07:27
your Python interpreter we will import the request module to make a request to
11:07:33
an API then we'll need widgets widgets are the building blocks of a PIQT5
11:07:38
application from the package of PIQT5 access the module of QT
11:07:46
widgets import the following widgets q
11:07:52
application Q widget Q
11:07:57
label Q lineedit Q push
11:08:03
button let me put some of these on a new line for readability
11:08:10
qv box layout this is a vertical layout
11:08:16
manager to work with alignment we'll need the following from the package of
11:08:21
piqt5 from the module of QT core import the following class QT which is used for
11:08:30
alignment so these are the imports that you'll need just to be sure that I didn't misspell anything or get the
11:08:37
capitalization wrong I'm just going to do a test run no problems processed
11:08:42
finished with exit code zero sometimes I make one of these characters lowercase and then it doesn't
11:08:49
work okay we have our imports we will need to create a class of weather app
11:08:57
weather app is going to inherit from the parent of Q widget
11:09:04
we will need a constructor so we'll define that under init arguments besides
11:09:10
self in case we have arguments to send to the parent we will call the parent
11:09:16
with super meaning the superass then call the constructor but
11:09:21
currently we don't have any arguments if we are running our main Python file directly we can verify that
11:09:28
with an if statement if dunder name is equal to a string of dunder
11:09:37
main if we are running this file directly then we will create a weather app object otherwise we won't if this
11:09:45
statement is true we will do the following we will create an app object
11:09:51
app equals call the constructor within our Q application class but we will pass
11:09:56
in the following access the module of CIS then access a argv which means
11:10:03
arguments if we have command line arguments to send to our application this is how we would take care of that
11:10:10
but we're not going to be using command line arguments in this video but it's nice to futureroof our code just in case
11:10:15
we do we will construct a weather app object weather app equals call the
11:10:22
constructor of our weather app class now this window isn't going to show we have
11:10:27
to call the show method of our weather app weather app show and now it's going to show for a
11:10:34
brief second we need to ensure a clean exit access
11:10:40
cis call the exit method within this method we will pass in the following
11:10:46
take our app call the execute method which is
11:10:52
execore it is a method so we have to call it this method handles events
11:10:57
within our application such as closing the window so now our window should stay in
11:11:03
place until we close it if you're one of the people that have jumped ahead we have created a class of
11:11:11
weather app which inherits from the parent of Q widget we've constructed a weather app object and we're showing it
11:11:19
if you've made some PIQT5 projects in the past you would just have to change some of these
11:11:24
around within the constructor of our class weather app we will declare the different widgets that belong to our
11:11:30
weather app object we will create a label that prompts the user to enter in a city we will name this city label
11:11:38
equals this is a Q label widget we can set the initial text of the label let's
11:11:46
say enter city name then the second argument is going
11:11:52
to be self we are adding this label to our weather app object here's what we
11:11:58
have currently we still have to do some CSS formatting but we'll take care of that
11:12:05
soon we will need a line edit widget basically a text box we will name it
11:12:12
city input the widget is line
11:12:19
edit no parameters besides self here is our line edit widget we're
11:12:27
not currently using a layout manager these widgets are going to overlap we need a button
11:12:36
self.get weather button this is a Q push
11:12:43
button the text on this button will be get weather we are adding this to self
11:12:50
our weather app object here's our button when we click on this button
11:12:57
we'll make a request to an API for the next following widgets we're going to add some placeholders just so that we
11:13:03
can see what we're doing when we apply CSS styling we need a temperature label to
11:13:08
display the temperature temperature label equals a Q
11:13:17
label temporarily for the label let's say that the temperature is 70° F or
11:13:24
pick something else in Celsius so to add a degree symbol if you're using Windows make sure num lock is on hold alt then
11:13:31
on the numpad type 0176 i will pick 70° F
11:13:37
and then we will add this to self again we're just using this temperature as a placeholder we'll
11:13:43
delete it when we do a test run if you would like to include an emoji or some other image we can create
11:13:50
a label for that i will name this emoji label equals a Q
11:13:58
label i will add an emoji of a sun as a placeholder again we're going to delete
11:14:05
this when we do a test run we are adding this to
11:14:11
self again everything is overlapping that is fine and we need a description of the
11:14:19
weather description label equals a Q
11:14:26
label as a placeholder let's say that it's sunny and we are adding this label
11:14:32
to self okay here are all the widgets they're all overlapping so we need to
11:14:39
fix that all right moving on everybody so
11:14:44
now we have to design the layout of our web app right now all of our widgets are
11:14:50
gravitating to the top left corner so I will define a method to initialize our user
11:15:01
interface at the end of this constructor we will call this method self.initialize initialize UI then call it once we've
11:15:10
constructed our widgets we'll format them and design the layout so we are now within our
11:15:17
initialize user interface method first let's set the title of our
11:15:22
window self set window
11:15:27
title let's say that the title is weather app
11:15:32
so that should change which it does we're going to use a vertical
11:15:38
layout manager to handle all the widgets let's name the layout manager
11:15:44
VBox equals call the constructor of the class QVox layout we're going to take
11:15:51
our layout manager of VBox then add a widget we will start with the city label
11:15:59
that's first we will pass in self.c city label
11:16:05
and we'll do this with the other widgets too we have city
11:16:13
input get weather
11:16:18
button temperature
11:16:24
label emoji label and then a description label
11:16:36
take self our weather app set the layout we will pass in the layout manager of
11:16:44
VBox and here's what we have currently all the widgets are arranged
11:16:51
in a column now we just have to center align them horizontally here's
11:16:58
how we will take self.c city label call the set alignment
11:17:07
method access the class of QT access the flag of align
11:17:14
center we're going to align all of our widgets in the center except for our weather button currently our button
11:17:21
expands to take up the width of the window so we don't need to horizontally
11:17:26
align that so we have five widgets to align we have city label city input
11:17:35
temperature label emoji label and description label all of the widgets are going to be
11:17:42
arranged in a column horizontally now we just have to apply some CSS styling because right now it's
11:17:50
kind of ugly we will apply styles based on an object name but we have to set that
11:17:56
object name so let's start with our city label self city
11:18:02
label call the set object name
11:18:08
method pass in a unique ID for this widget i will name it city label i'll
11:18:14
keep it the same okay we have to do this with the other widgets too we have a total of six
11:18:22
we have city label city input we have the get weather
11:18:33
button temperature label emoji
11:18:38
label and description label then we're going to set a
11:18:46
stylesheet take self our weather app apply a stylesheet with set style
11:18:52
sheet we have a lot of properties to write i will do so within a set of triple quotes just to keep everything
11:18:59
more organized we can apply CSS styles based on a class so the class is going to be Q
11:19:07
label within a set of curly braces we can list multiple CSS properties i will
11:19:13
set the font family to be Calibri
11:19:18
as well as all push buttons q push
11:19:23
button so here's the font although it's still kind of small let's select our ID
11:19:29
of city label it's good practice to preede this ID with the name of the class so Q label pound sign the
11:19:39
ID we preede the ID with the name of the class just so we're only applying these
11:19:44
CSS properties to any ID that's a city label that falls within the class of Q
11:19:51
label let's set the font size to be 40 pixels let's set the font size to be 40
11:19:59
pixels that's better i'll set the font style to be
11:20:05
itallic font style itallic that's pretty good
11:20:14
let's select the ID of city input this is a line edit widget q
11:20:21
lineedit pound the ID of city input within a set of curly
11:20:27
braces let's set the font size to be 40 pixels
11:20:39
we will select our push button which is named get weather button the class is Q
11:20:45
push button pound the ID of get weather button within a set of curly braces we
11:20:52
will apply the following let's set the font size to be 30
11:21:00
pixels and let's make it bold font weight
11:21:11
bold let's select our temperature label the ID is temperature label and
11:21:17
this is a Q label pound temperature label we will increase the font
11:21:25
size font size 75 pixels
11:21:34
better let's work on our emoji next we will select the ID of emoji
11:21:43
label the class is Q label the ID is emoji
11:21:49
label we'll set the font size first font size 100 pixels i would like a large
11:21:58
image to display emojis properly we're going to use a very specific font we're
11:22:04
going to set the font family to be now I don't know if I'm saying this right
11:22:12
segi emoji i probably pronounced this word wrong but I don't
11:22:20
care so then our emoji should display correctly using this font it's
11:22:27
colorful then we have the description label of the weather that is the last widget description label the class is Q
11:22:35
label the ID is description label let's take the font size and set
11:22:43
it to be 50 pixels all right so this is what our
11:22:48
weather app is going to look like we have the city label a text box to enter
11:22:54
in a city the get weather button the temperature label an emoji label and a
11:23:00
description of the weather currently now we just have to add some functionality because currently this doesn't do
11:23:08
anything all right so now we just have to add some functionality to our weather app temporarily I'm going to collapse
11:23:15
our initialize user interface method we will define a few extra methods let's
11:23:20
declare a method of get weather no parameters besides self i'll
11:23:27
write pass for now as a placeholder we will need a method to display any errors display
11:23:36
error there's going to be one argument besides self a message we will pass in
11:23:41
an error message if there is one and a method to display weather
11:23:49
that's if there's no errors we will need some data our weather
11:23:55
data so be sure that you write these three methods back within our initialize user
11:24:02
interface method at the bottom we have to connect a signal to a
11:24:09
slot when we click on the button with the signal of clicked we will connect a
11:24:15
slot of get weather we will access self take our get weather
11:24:23
button with a signal of clicked we will connect a slot of self.get
11:24:32
weather and I will print a test message just to be sure that it's working
11:24:38
you get the weather so I press the button and we
11:24:44
will display you get the weather we can get rid of our
11:24:50
placeholder text for the temperature our emoji and the weather
11:24:55
description so we can delete these strings but be sure to keep
11:25:06
self scrolling down to our get weather method when we click the button we're
11:25:12
going to create a few local variables the first is going to be our API key
11:25:19
equals this will be a string back to the open weather API you
11:25:25
will copy your API key and make sure that it's active you can use the toggle button to make it inactive and
11:25:32
active so make sure that it's active paste your API key within a string
11:25:40
please use your own it still may take several minutes for your key to be active just keep that in
11:25:46
mind we will need to get the city that we're looking up so let's say we type in Miami i have
11:25:55
to get the text from this widget this line ededit widget we will create a
11:26:00
local variable of city city equals access our line edit widget it had a
11:26:07
name of city input so self.c city input to get the
11:26:15
text we will call the text method we have the API key and the city
11:26:21
now we will create a URL this will be an fstring using the request module we will
11:26:28
pass in a URL to make a request to so back to our open weather API to
11:26:35
get the URL for a city we have to go to the tab of API scroll down to current weather data
11:26:44
and there's going to be some API documentation to the right we have a link for built-in API request by city
11:26:51
name we will copy this URL and paste it within our F string
11:26:59
there's two changes we're going to make we will replace city name with city the
11:27:04
name of that variable and API space key with
11:27:11
API_key it doesn't matter what you name these just make sure they're consistent with your variables when we make an API request we
11:27:19
will be returned with a response object response equals access our module of
11:27:26
requests call the get method then pass in our
11:27:32
URL with our response object we have to convert it to a JSON
11:27:37
format we will be returned with an object we will name this object data it's going to be readable to us data
11:27:45
equals take our response object and use the JSON method to convert it to a JSON
11:27:51
format at so let's print our data to see what we're working
11:27:57
with let's say I look up the city of
11:28:04
Miami so we have one gigantic object this is our weather data we have
11:28:11
coordinates such as longitude and latitude a weather description
11:28:18
currently in Miami there's broken clouds there's an ID of the weather this
11:28:24
is the temperature but it's in Kelvin if we scroll all the way to the end we are looking for an HTTP status
11:28:33
code which is named Cood short for code 200 means that the response was
11:28:39
successful depending on what this number is we will display one of the few error messages if our status code is 404 that
11:28:47
means the city wasn't found and there's many others so 200 means that the
11:28:52
request was successful so let's write the following if our data object at key of
11:29:03
COD if this is equal to 200 if the request was successful then we will call
11:29:10
the display weather method self display weather but we do have to pass in our
11:29:19
data now temporarily I'm just going to print our weather data we'll do some
11:29:25
more complex stuff later but I just want to be sure that everything is working so let's look up Los
11:29:34
Angeles so here's the weather in Los Angeles
11:29:39
there is currently broken clouds and again the status code is 200
11:29:45
the request was successful i'll write an else statement for now we will print our data what if
11:29:54
we can't find a city for example I will look up the city blah blah blah and get
11:30:01
the weather so here's our weather data we
11:30:06
have an error code of 404 and a message of city not found let's do some
11:30:12
exception handling in case we run into one of these status codes that's not 200 we can get rid of our else
11:30:20
statement what we'll do is enclose all of our dangerous code that means any
11:30:25
code that might cause an exception within a try block we will try all of this code and handle
11:30:33
any exceptions with an accept block there's two types of exceptions we're looking for the first is an HTTP
11:30:45
error http error is an exception raised by the request module when an HTTP
11:30:52
request returns a status code that's 400 or 500 however this exception is found
11:30:59
within the request module that we've imported so we can't simply just say
11:31:06
accept HTTP error we first have to access the request module then access
11:31:14
exceptions then we can list the specific exception of HTTP error
11:31:20
will encounter this exception if the status code is between 400 and
11:31:28
500 and for now I'll write pass so there's one more step within our
11:31:34
try block if we're going to handle any HTTP errors we have to raise an
11:31:39
exception within our try block because our try block by itself normally doesn't
11:31:44
catch these we will take our response object and call the raise for status
11:31:54
method this method will raise an exception if there's any HTTP errors
11:32:01
normally our try block doesn't do that so we have to manually type this there's another type of exception
11:32:08
we'll catch and that's the request exception we'll add another block for
11:32:14
accept request
11:32:19
exception this is found within the request module
11:32:24
requests exceptions request exception with a request exception this
11:32:32
can be due to network problems invalid URLs exceptions of that nature
11:32:37
in case we run into one of those types of exceptions we will execute this block of code but for now I'll write pass
11:32:44
we'll get back to it later going back to our accept block where we handle any HTTP errors let's
11:32:51
use a match case statement we need to get the status code of our response i'll
11:32:56
print that temporarily let's print our response objects status code and see what it
11:33:06
is again let's make up a city get the weather we have a status code of 404
11:33:13
that means the city wasn't found depending on what this number is the status code we'll use a match case
11:33:21
statement so we will match our response objects status
11:33:30
code the first case will be 400 that means there's a bad
11:33:38
request so let's print the following bad request i'll add a new
11:33:46
line character please check your
11:33:52
input we'll create a total of I believe eight cases we'll copy what we
11:34:01
have so we have 400 401
11:34:06
403 404 that one we're familiar with
11:34:12
500 502
11:34:19
503 504 so for case 401 that means we're
11:34:26
unauthorized maybe our API key isn't active yet so let's say
11:34:36
unauthorized invalid API key
11:34:43
for 403 that means access is denied it's forbidden so let's print
11:34:53
forbidden access is denied 404 is for something that's not
11:35:01
found not found city not found
11:35:10
500 is for an internal server error internal server error please try
11:35:18
again later 502 is for a bad
11:35:25
gateway bad gateway invalid response from the
11:35:30
server
11:35:38
503 is for service unavailable service
11:35:44
unavailable server is down then 504 is for a gateway
11:35:55
timeout gateway time out no response from the
11:36:00
server
11:36:08
in case there's any unexpected error we can add a wild card of an
11:36:14
underscore with our HTTP error let's give it a name as HTTP
11:36:22
error and then we'll just print it in case there are no matching cases let's
11:36:27
print the following http
11:36:32
error occurred i'll add a new line let's convert this to an
11:36:39
string add a placeholder and then I will print our HTTP
11:36:45
error all right let's do a test run so in case we can't find our city we
11:36:52
should encounter a 404 error not found city not found
11:36:57
eventually we will display this message within our app but we know that it works what if my API key is
11:37:06
invalid so I will take my API key set it to be inactive but it might take a few minutes
11:37:13
to take effect the status code of our response object should be
11:37:19
401 so this time I'm going to look up a city i have an invalid API
11:37:25
key and I get that error message of unauthorized invalid API
11:37:31
key all right everybody so I am on day three of working on and recording this topic over the course of the day I
11:37:38
thought of one change that I can make we're going to add a few extra accept blocks so we will accept access requests
11:37:46
access exceptions we will handle any connection error exceptions
11:37:56
as well as any timeout
11:38:03
exceptions and any redirects too many
11:38:15
redirects so if we run into a connection error let's say that our internet gets
11:38:20
disconnected well we can print something so let's print the following let's print
11:38:26
connection error i'll add a new line character check your internet
11:38:36
connection if we encounter a timeout then we will print the
11:38:41
following we have a timeout error
11:38:48
the request timed out if we have a too many redirects
11:38:54
error that M should be capital by the
11:39:00
way let's state too many
11:39:08
redirects check the URL and if there's anything else we
11:39:15
don't anticipate I'll give this exception a name of as wreck
11:39:21
error and then we'll just print it this is a last resort i'll use an f
11:39:28
string request error i'll add a new line i'll add a
11:39:35
placeholder then display our request error so I'm actually going to turn off
11:39:40
my internet i'll see if I can get a connection error intentionally so my internet is
11:39:46
currently off i will attempt to look up a city get the weather and we get a
11:39:52
connection error check your internet connection all right my internet is
11:39:58
connected again let's perform a test
11:40:03
run and we get the weather in Miami now what we're going to do is if we have
11:40:10
an error we'll display the error message within the app and not within our
11:40:18
console so we're going to replace print with a call to our display error method
11:40:24
let me zoom out a little bit so replace print with self dot display
11:40:31
error and we're passing in a message so let's replace
11:40:43
those one thing I forgot to add although it's not necessary I'm going to add a
11:40:48
colon after each initial message i think it'll look
11:40:54
better you don't have to do this but I'm OCD about the appearance
11:41:00
if we encounter one of these exceptions we'll pass along a message to our display error method and display it
11:41:06
within the app let's take our temperature label self temperature
11:41:14
label and set the text to be our message that we pass
11:41:23
in let's do a test run let's look up a city that doesn't exist
11:41:28
get the weather so we get that error message not found city not found while
11:41:35
we're within this method I'm going to change the font size just so that it's a little bit
11:41:43
smaller so let's take our temperature label self dot temperature label i'm
11:41:49
just going to copy this because I'm lazy i will call the set stylesheet
11:41:54
method and pass along a new property let's set the font size to 30
11:42:03
pixels let's look up North Pole i don't think that's a
11:42:09
city oh I guess it is
11:42:15
interesting the North Pole is a city I guess let's look up blah blah
11:42:21
blah not found city not found let's do another test what if our API
11:42:28
key is invalid i'll just delete one of the digits let's look up Los
11:42:36
Angeles unauthorized invalid API key let's change that back again i will
11:42:44
turn off my internet then look up Miami connection error check your
11:42:51
internet connection all right so we know that our exception handling works okay now we're within the display
11:42:58
weather method we'll receive an object to represent our data we have to get the
11:43:05
temperature but first I'm going to print our data so let me zoom in a little
11:43:11
bit let's look up Houston houston
11:43:16
Texas i need the temperature within our data object we are looking for a key of
11:43:23
main and that is right here main contains a dictionary with key value
11:43:28
pairs once we've accessed main we have to access temp to get the temperature
11:43:34
and this temperature is in Kelvin we'll have to convert it to Celsius or Fahrenheit it's your
11:43:39
choice so we need to extract this value i will store it as a local variable
11:43:49
temperature let's say temperature K for Kelvin equals take our data object
11:43:56
access the key of main that's right here then we have to go one level deeper and
11:44:03
get the temperature the key is temp then give me the value at the key
11:44:09
of temp and that should return the current temperature so to test it let's
11:44:15
print it Let's print the temperature in Kelvin so what is the weather in Houston
11:44:22
Texas the temperature that is 309
11:44:28
Kelvin let's convert it to Celsius and Fahrenheit let's create temperature C if
11:44:35
you want to use Celsius if you would rather use Fahrenheit you can skip this step
11:44:41
to convert from Kelvin to Celsius we will take our temperature in Kelvin subtract
11:44:49
273.15 then for Fahrenheit let's take temperature F for
11:44:55
Fahrenheit equals this is a little more complicated take our temperature in
11:45:02
Kelvin times 9 / 5 subtract 459.67
11:45:10
67 okay so let's print the temperature in
11:45:17
Celsius let's look up Houston
11:45:23
36.46° C then in Fahrenheit that would
11:45:31
be 97.6° F that's pretty
11:45:37
hot all right so once we have our temperature let's change the temperature label self temperature label i'll just
11:45:45
copy this then we will set the text i'll use an F
11:45:51
string add a placeholder i'll use Fahrenheit but feel free to use
11:45:57
Celsius then I will add a degree symbol with Windows make sure num lock is on
11:46:02
hold alt then on your numpad type 0176 for a degree symbol then F for
11:46:10
Fahrenheit let's look up Miami get the weather and here's the
11:46:16
temperature 94.964 now let's say I would like no digits after the decimal i can add a
11:46:23
format specifier after our temperature i'll add a colon 0F to display no
11:46:30
decimals let's try that again i will look up Miami get the weather the
11:46:37
current temperature in Fahrenheit is 95° F now here's one issue let's say we
11:46:45
display an air then display the weather if we display an error we're going to be changing the font
11:46:50
size so let's look up blah blah blah got the weather city not found then let's
11:46:58
look up Miami again got the weather and the font size is a lot smaller so if we
11:47:05
display the weather let's reset the font size we can really just copy this
11:47:11
line so within the display weather method let's set the font size back to
11:47:17
75 what it was originally let's try that
11:47:23
again let's look up a city that doesn't exist get the weather city not found
11:47:28
then we'll look up a city that does exist like Miami and get the weather
11:47:34
95° F now let's get a description of the weather we'll display that at the bottom
11:47:40
in the center we'll display a picture or an emoji but we'll handle that last now we need a description of the
11:47:47
weather like is it sunny is it cloudy is it raining so after we calculate the
11:47:53
temperature so I'm going to print our data
11:47:58
again let's look up Los Angeles
11:48:04
so currently it's 85° F so for the weather description that is found at the key of
11:48:11
weather we're now within a list at index zero within our
11:48:17
list we'll look up the key of description which states clear sky
11:48:23
so we will create a local variable of weather
11:48:30
description equals access our data at the key of
11:48:40
weather there's layers to this we're then within a list and actually it's a list with only
11:48:48
one item in it so at the index of zero then at the key of
11:48:57
description that's going to return this description of clear
11:49:03
sky so we will take our description label self.escription label let me just
11:49:10
copy it this one right here
11:49:17
then we will set the text and then pass in our weather
11:49:23
description what is the weather description of Los
11:49:29
Angeles 86° F and there's a clear sky okay now the last thing we're going
11:49:36
to do is add an emoji we'll add it right to the center between the temperature and the weather description you don't
11:49:42
necessarily have to but I think it'll look cool and that's a good enough reason so let's create another method to
11:49:50
handle that we will define a method of get weather
11:49:57
emoji or a picture if you would rather use a picture we don't need self
11:50:02
necessarily we're going to need a weather ID
11:50:07
this method isn't going to rely on any class data or instance data we could
11:50:12
make it a static method i'll add a decorator of static method in summary a static method we
11:50:20
haven't covered these for a little bit they belong to a class but don't require any instance specific data or any other
11:50:28
methods they're used as more of a utility tool we're going to be passing in a weather ID and returning an emoji
11:50:38
i'm going to show you where we can find that weather ID i'll use a print statement i will print our
11:50:47
data let's look up Miami again that's the first thing that came to
11:50:54
mind now at the key of weather there's a key of ID and the value is a three-digit
11:51:00
number i'll show you this chart depending on what this three-digit number is that corresponds to a certain
11:51:07
group of weather so the 200 range is a thunderstorm 300 is a drizzle 500 is
11:51:15
rain 600 is snow 700 is atmosphere like if there's a
11:51:21
tornado or there's a volcanic eruption 800 exactly is a clear sky
11:51:29
anything that's 801 or above refers to clouds so this ID is 803 we have broken
11:51:36
clouds depending on what this ID is I would like to return a certain emoji
11:51:42
based on the weather so we need this ID i'll delete our print statement we no
11:51:47
longer need it let's say before our weather description we will create a local variable of weather
11:51:54
ID equals access our data object then access the key of
11:52:04
weather the value at weather is a list but this list only has one item in it so
11:52:11
we need the index of operator at zero and then we will access the key of
11:52:19
ID the key is ID so our weather ID is going to be a number a three-digit
11:52:25
number okay everybody we're near the end so after setting the temperature we're
11:52:31
going to set the emoji label self.oji
11:52:37
label and call the set text method within the set text method we
11:52:44
will call self.get weather emoji method this will return a string an
11:52:51
emoji within a string but we have to pass in our weather ID
11:52:56
it's that three-digit number so now we are within our get weather emoji
11:53:02
method depending on the range of that three-digit number we will return one of a few emojis we could use a match case
11:53:10
statement i think it's more complicated with the match case statement we'll use else if statements for simplicity
11:53:17
so if our weather ID is greater than or equal to 200 and
11:53:25
our weather ID is less than or equal to
11:53:30
232 now we have two conditions here linked with the and logical operator there is a shortcut to this and
11:53:38
actually PyCharm is telling me that there is we can simplify these expressions instead of two separate
11:53:45
conditions we can combine them into one if 200 is less than or equal to our
11:53:51
weather ID and our weather ID is less than or equal to 232 if this one
11:53:57
combined condition is true then we will return an emoji so to add an emoji on Windows you
11:54:05
can hold down the window key and press semicolon
11:54:10
so 200 to 232 that's for a thunderstorm depending on the font style
11:54:16
of your IDE some of these emojis might not display properly you can always just
11:54:21
copy them from someplace else i think that's better it's more
11:54:27
colorful then else if 300 is less than or equal to our
11:54:34
weather ID and our weather ID is less than or equal to
11:54:41
321 this is for a partially cloudy sky we will
11:54:48
return some clouds a partially cloudy sky and again I don't like that one so
11:54:54
let's use this one instead else if 500 is less than or equal to our
11:55:04
weather ID which is less than or equal to
11:55:10
531 we will return
11:55:16
rain eh that's
11:55:22
better 600 to 622 Else if 600 is less than or equal to
11:55:29
our weather ID which is less than or equal to
11:55:37
622 we will return
11:55:45
snow so 701 to 741 is mist or fog else
11:55:52
if 701 is less than or equal to our weather
11:55:58
ID which is less than or equal to 741 we will return some mist or
11:56:09
fog 762 specifically is for ash like from a
11:56:14
volcano so else if our weather id is directly equal to
11:56:23
762 we will return let's return a
11:56:31
volcano 771 is for a squall that's a violent gust of wind else if our weather
11:56:39
ID is directly equal to 771
11:56:45
one we will return let's return that a violent gust
11:56:53
of wind a squall 781 is for a
11:56:58
tornado else if our weather ID is equal to
11:57:04
781 return a tornado
11:57:12
800 exactly is for a clear sky else if our weather ID is equal to
11:57:20
800 return a sun a sun
11:57:27
emoji else if 801 is less than or equal
11:57:32
to our weather ID which is less than or equal to
11:57:38
804 we will return some
11:57:49
clouds now if there are no matches let's return an empty string to not display
11:57:55
anything okay let's do a test run let's look up
11:58:03
Miami we get scattered clouds it's 94°
11:58:08
los Angeles got the weather we have a clear sky and a sun now there's one fix we
11:58:16
need to make let's say that I make up a city again blah blah blah got the
11:58:23
weather we should clear our emoji label and the weather description but we still
11:58:28
get that error message so after we display our error within the
11:58:34
display error method after we set the text of the temperature label let's take
11:58:40
the emoji label self.oji label and call the clear method to clear
11:58:47
it then we have to do this with the description label self.escription
11:58:55
label and call the clear method now we should be able to clear it when we get
11:59:02
an error okay let's look up Houston get the
11:59:07
weather few clouds 98° let's make up a city pizza City get
11:59:15
the weather not found city not found and the emoji label and the weather
11:59:21
description are cleared okay what if I type in nothing what happens let's get the weather we
11:59:28
have a bad request please check your input that's if we have an HTTP status
11:59:34
code of 400 we handled this exception bad request all right one last city what
11:59:42
about Paris let's get the weather it is 68 degrees Fahrenheit and there's light
11:59:49
rain all right everybody so that is a weather app that you can make using Python add it to your portfolio and
11:59:56
thanks for watching
